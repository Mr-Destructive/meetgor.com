## Change directory dot command

If you are in a sqlite shell and forgot to change directory or want to navigate to a separate directory, you can do that with the `.cd` dot command.

```sqlite
.cd /path/to/directory
```

This is better than doing `.shell cd /path/to/directory` because it doesn't open a separate terminal process. So, the `.cd` is persistant throughout the session, whereas the `.shell cd <path>` will only within that command (subprocess).

The `.cd` command changes the working directory of the SQLite shell itself, so the change persists for the rest of the session. This means commands like `.import`, `.read`, or `.output` will automatically look for files in the new directory.

However, `.shell cd <path>` spawns a separate subprocess, and the directory change is discarded as soon as that command finishes. It does not affect SQLiteâ€™s own state of the current directory.

So if you plan to read or write multiple files from a different location during your SQLite session, prefer the built-in `.cd` command.
