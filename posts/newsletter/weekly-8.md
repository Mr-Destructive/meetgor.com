## Week #8

This week was quite a slow one for me, I didn’t write much code, but I did some thinking and debugging deep into configurations. I want to say this, that’s it, not in the mood for a rant this week.

## Quote of the week

> “Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.’”
> 
> — Mary Anne Radmacher

The quote is really apt for the week for me, I actually had no or very little progress this week, maybe I was a little distracted with life, but that doesn’t mean I quit this newsletter, I will show up, I will write it even I have nothing to write, When I read this in the future, I will be proud when I wrote when no one was reading, no one was watching me. I will try again next week.

## Wrote/Created

* **LibSQL Embedded Replicas on Turso in Golang**  
    I created my second youtube video, this took considerably less time for the voice over but the video content was really time consuming to make the final edit. But i enjoyed the process of creating the flow video.
    

## Watched

* **Notion cut latency by 20% using SQLite  
    **This is such an insightful video, by neetcode, the content is really worth watching, to the point and really a lot of thins learnt. A lot of concepts like Web workers which I am not even aware of, using SQLite in browser with WASM feels really powerful.
    
* 5 Good Practises in Python  
    
* New Python 3.13 REPL is so cool  
    The python REPL looks really cool and will significantly improve the developer experience with this release, the block navigation is really handy and so frustrating at certain times.
    

## Learnt

* [Using LibSQL/SQLite embedded replicas on Turso](https://docs.turso.tech/features/embedded-replicas/introduction)
    
    * Created some examples for using embedded replicas in Golang for the video, and will shortly push the changes to GitHub as well.
        
    * Understanding on a high level how embedded replicas work and where they could fit the software landscape.
