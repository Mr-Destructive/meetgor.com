## Week #37

A bit of a hectic week. For the past quarter, the weeks have been quite rough, and this is continuing this month too. Need to really breathe air, and take my mind off for a while. But something hurts to quit and take a rest. Bad habits are really hard to break, like not creating a video is becoming my bad habit, really deciding to take action and actual action is the biggest difference.

But somehow we are trapped in the fear of taking action and people still judge us because we spent time and failed, instead someone tried too little effort, still managed to get over the hurdle, or someone worked too hard to get it done. And I lie in the middle, torn between duty and burnout.

Anyway, it’sbeen a bit frustrating week so far, just need to divert my mind to other places and get back on track for video creation and learning up the hill.

### Quote of the week

> “The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity."  
> — *Dorothy Parker*

Curiosity is the fire, that can kindle life’s biggest paths. I have started reading tiny experiments books, so far it seems that just having no clarity in life, but having curiosity and figuring out on the way is the way of life. For me, some things were luxury at one time, but suddenly in a moment they've become the only option to get out of the puddle I am in. Life is a bit drastic, curiosity is the fire that will keep one alive in the darkest of times.

#### TIL: [Add hunks/patches in a single file with git add -p](https://dev.meetgor.com/til/add-hunks-only-line-specific-changes-with-git-add-p/)

- It was a TIL actually, I was just frustrated to open VS Code, I had already made the next changes and wanted to fix a bug, this helped fix the code without me reverting the local changes.

## Read

- [**Power to the people: How LLMs flip the script on technology diffusion**](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1909308143156240538)**:**
  This is a nice article written by AI Lord Andrej Karpathy, this nicely explains the current situation of the AI trend and how it is the reverse of every other revolution. An interesting perspective to think of and be grateful for living in this phase.

- [We won’t hire a junior engineer with 5 years of experience](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-won-t-hire-a-junior-with-five-years-of-experience-0a548994)  
  This is a bit scary like I am new and haven’t contributed significantly to anything. I have the fire, but life gets in the way. I am not a person who would give excuses. I truly am confused with life lately. The trajectory of the engineer will be seen in the early days so accurately put.
- [Universal basic dead-end](https://world.hey.com/dhh/universal-basic-dead-end-8b7178b9)  
  We are in the AI revolution right now, just like how we had the computer revolution. People thought, everyone would lose their jobs, but are we out of jobs? In fact, there are more jobs than ever. Right now, yes the market is bad, and the jobs are fewer, but does that mean AI will replace humans? If yes, you are in the wrong world.

## Watched

- Model Context Protocol
  MCP buzz is all over the place. But think above and beyond the hype. The core question is why do we want LLM to answer for us, its smart, but not very predictable.

## Learnt

- Using git add patch to add hunks and patches within a file
    - We can use [git add -p](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging) to add chunks (hunks? patches?) whatever that is called, to stage changes of a file and not the entire file

So, let’s wrap up this week, which has been a bit harsh for me. Locking out on Friday from work at 10, no it was not forced, I was just curious to fix that damn bug. But alas despite all the efforts, the bug was not solved entirely, still the core remains making me feel a little sad but a bit satisfied as the major issue was resolved.

See you next week, Bye

Happy Coding :)
