## Week #48

An fruitful week, not much on tech created, but a lot of learning and revising about the first principal thinking.

I tried to create a Pocket clone in Typescript with some AI-assisted (a bit of vibe coding) because I don’t like writing frontend. I failed a few times, and even my network seems to be off for a while, so I had to scrape that idea and stop streaming for the weekend. So, it didn’t quite work out. Instead this weekend I’ll only stream on Saturday to start one project.

I read and consumed a lot of stuff this week. I need to be creating and writing more too. The balance is essential.

I will share one small achievement and progress on my non-tech journey. I wrote 8,000 words approximately on one my Novel (or novella I don’t know yet). I wrote consistently for a week, 1 hour every day, averaging of 1200 words per day. A good start I think, better late then never. I have been procrastinating this for quite some time, in terms of years now. Finally Friday, 20th June 2025 was the day I beat that devil and my hear finally won. It looks small, on the out, but I think this is a start of something big. A turn that I want to remember when I reflect back on my life.

### Quote of the week

> “The thing that you are most resisting is probably the thing you most need to do.”  
> — *Steven Pressfield, The War of Art*

I have read the book, the war of art, and this quote speaks to me like fire. Something has resisted me from getting into fantasy and creative writing. But here I am after a week of writing consistently. I feel liberated and joyed. There is so much to do, too little time, too many pages to fill, too many characters to paint, too many stories to tell and most importantly so many lives to be kindled with writing.

## Created

- LLM plugin for code agent with Code toolbox
- Tried to create a reader app for collecting and reading articles or content
    - Like Mozilla’s Pocket, but focused on reading individual as well collected resources in a simplified interface, distraction free reading
    - I get a lot of articles to read, sometimes, I get lost in between tabs and to be read articles, so I wanted to create a simple that lets me dump links to it and later I can skim through them for reading with a simple interface for reading.

## Read

1. [Pheonix. new Fly’s entry for AI coding agents](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/23/phoenix-new/)
    - This is a neat little thing from fly.io, they have made everything so right, that these AI Agents just fit perfectly in their ecosystem.
2. [Using AI right now: A quick guide](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/using-ai-right-now-a-quick-guide)
    - Gemini, ChatGPT and Claude these are the most widely adopted LLMs which are quite general purpose. But they also have nuanced quirks and preferences for certain tasks.
    - Deep Research is a big deal and it has helped me learn a new concept every day. I use Grok AI, Gemini AI, Chat GPT and even mistral ai for specific things.
    - Hallucinations are no longer a big deal in AI, they have reduced considerably over the years. It is still a problem but not what it used to be.
3. [SQL Join flavors](https://antonz.org/sql-join/)
    - This was a insightful post, it helped me feed my hunger for learning more about SQL.
    - The qualified, natural (Actually unnatural) and cross broad range of joins really helped understand the concepts better.
    - The interactive examples are really great for those types of complex yet powerful concepts.
4. [AI-free Writing](https://antonz.org/ai-free/)
    - Anton won’t use AI for writing, I am on his side. I write this newsletter and any writing for that matter without GPT or AI. Yes, I use it as a critique and help me understand how it reads, I read its thoughts and think and leave them. Next time, I be a little considerate about those mistakes.
5. [Golang 1.25 interactive tour](https://antonz.org/go-1-25/)
    - The json v2 package and the in-depth explanations are helpful in quick understanding of the changes. It has given me a good view on what is changing and is enough motivation for me to tinker on my own and create other examples.
6. [Anatomy of a SQL Engine: Dolthub Blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-25-sql-engine-anatomy/)
    - This was a interesting post. It made me curious how a sql statement query is executed, the ast construction, then right recursive and left recursive. This blog actually made me take a in-depth guide on SQL.
    - I have started reading about SQL and solving leetcode problems and even some problems on SQLBolt. I have even picked up reading “Learning SQL” Book for learning more. I want to get into “Database Internals”, that book is about how under-the-hood sql and databases work, for that I need to learn what SQL is in the first place.
7. [Docker launches hardened base images](https://www.docker.com/blog/introducing-docker-hardened-images/)
    - DHI are the new thing in docker, they help in avoiding the image bloat.
    - They are not just trimmed-down versions of existing containers, they’re built from the ground up which is really interesting to work with and help optimise the build process as well as deployment constraints.

  > Docker Hardened Images start with a dramatically reduced attack surface, up to 95% smaller, to limit exposure from the outset.
8. [Kubernetes isn’t for you](https://dev.to/code42cate/kubernetes-isnt-for-you-2c2m)
    - Kubernetes is made for the scale of google, where they have millions, billions of request per minute. Not for your 100 user startup. True, if the scale keep growing, or you have micro-service architecture, but if you have a bare-bones project and not many user-base, then sticking to simple traditional deployment is good enough
    - I hate when people use shiny things for making themselves look like they know what they are doing, the soy devs, the gigachad 100x developers, and they only know what a pod actually means in a cluster.
    - Why make things complex, it feels great at first for our egoistic brain, but believe me the complexity will hurt you in the long run. Maybe it will save you too if you are actually growing at scale. But the trade-off you need to decide.
9. [Gemini CLI breakdown by Simon Wilson](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/25/gemini-cli/)
    - Google has really taken the time to build something of high-enough standard in the space of AI Agents in the terminal. This is a serious competition to Claude Code.
    - I wonder what OpenAI missed with Codex. It just is bad. Not even usable to free users, which Google just took it by storm.

    - The system prompt is really insightful, the tools are nicely laid out, its so simple yet well architectured.
10. [Now might be the best time to learn software development](https://greenbluegray.substack.com/p/now-might-be-the-best-time-to-learn?utm_source=%2Fhistory&utm_medium=reader2)
    - The best time to learn software development was 5 years ago, now is the next best time to learn it.

## Watched

- [How did they get their first Jobs](https://youtu.be/_CwpzZ8AVio?si=6VdVOSjgznwXiqUM)
    - Teej had some serious advice, having cover letters, showing that you care is so valuable. I have started to do that (oops, I am looking for a job actively, trying to get a switch after a year and half at my current company)
    - Prime had a good take, it just happened to him after he had worked and seriously worked hard enough. He was just doing his best and suddenly luck gave him a chance and he took it with both hands.
    - The other person, forgot the name. Also had a symphatical journey.

- Cloudflare Containers
    - Containers they are really a game changer. Cloudflare does things and does it on scale. This hits different. This is some serious stuff, maybe even a revolution in how we use and build software. It literally can spin up a new computer on the cloud.

- [Sam Altman on AGI, GPT-5 and other stuff on the Open AI Podcast](https://youtu.be/DB9mjd-65gw?si=HYX0FbX93ni-k2Kv)
    - This is all nice and good on the talk, they really need to answer why the heck are they even developing the models and selling them.
    - I think the bubble is slowly going to burst and we are going to use AI surely but not the way we are thinking right now. Just as a tool.
    - Maybe search will be revolutionised with AI, but I don’t see it in other places, it’s not worth the time and money.

- [Gemini CLI and comparison with other Agentic Terminal Agents](https://youtu.be/ftGPty-dQR8?si=rryJ-7UL1K2IkXCZ)
    - Gemini CLI is really nice, at least for a free tier. I can use it and understand the LLMs capabilities. It helps junior developers get a taste of the software AI can produce, but these can really get double edged sword. Juniors will only produce AI slop and never learn anything.
    - But yes, google is trying hard to make developers happy for now.

## Learnt

- Javascript has quirky behaviour with null, undefined and what equality operator
    - We don’t know if the value is null or undefined, the object might be still undefined but it will be a truthy value
    - The equality operator is very wired, this teaches us that too much flexibility is also bad
          - For instance, the ‘5’ == 5 will be true but ‘5’ === 5 won’t be
          - The triple equal is a type check whereas the double equal is a value check after type casting, which might be a bit unpredictable as the data gets complex.
- Getting the unique elements from a list in Python without changing the order
    - After python 3.7 changes the dictionary, the order of the keys inserted is maintained, so we can use that to create a map of the elements in the list as a key in the dictionary and return the unique elements.
    - Neat little trick, could be well often be used widely in many cases.

  ```
  # this might change the order
  list(set(queue))

  # this will preserve the order
  # works for python > 3.7 
  list(dict.fromkeys(queue))
  ```
