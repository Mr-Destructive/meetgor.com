## Week #11

This week was good in terms of writing. I started a new endeavor: a blog. It is not technical; it is related to mythology and finding its meaning in the modern world. I kept a consistent writing routine for nine days. Nine posts in nine days looks like a good start for my writing routine. I will try to continue this routine throughout the month.

Moving on to the technical things, I wrote a lot less code than usual but read a lot of code for debugging and understanding existing flows.

## Quote of the week

> *Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful."*
> 
> — Albert Schweitzer

Success is the goal, and happiness is the process. If one can be happy in the process, it is already a great journey. Love the craft not the goal.

## Read

* [Refrain from the usage of dicts in the business logic in Python](https://roman.pt/posts/dont-let-dicts-spoil-your-code/):  
    I agree with this point, because the way dicts behave in complex structured code mess, is really hard to debug and trace.
    
* [What is new in Python 3.13](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html):  
    This is a big release in Python. It actually revamped the REPL experience to a new level. There is also the experimental addition of the JIT compiler.
    
* Data model behind the Notion’s flexibility:  
    The component-based model for Notion suits it really well. They used the right tools and architecture for the right job.
    

## Watched

* Communication in Engineering is vital, if technical skills are important then soft skills are the most important thing to have as a software engineer. If you can’t understandably express your thoughts, that could be a bit disadvantage to be honest. I personally struggle with this, I can communicate, but I am bit bad at it, I am trying to improve my vocal ability to express what is in my head effectively. I can write my thoughts really well, but when it comes to speaking, its a bit hard for me.
