## Week #26

This week was really fun and exciting, I am continuing with more productive weeks. I was able to fix a lot of things this week. I created three videos this week. Worked on the side project with 2 live streams. Was able to demonstrate to the team at my work about the AI Agents. It was a great week.

Next week I am planning to wrap up the series of CRUD Applications with Golang, Netlify cloud functions, and LibSQL by adding authentication and authorization.

### Quote of the week

I am keeping silent in this phase of my life, it is hard, but I haven’t quit, I am trying new things instead of crying, I am pushing through every sob, every hurdle, every pain that goes inside but comes out as a sweat. I am here to hunt, not to sit and wait for the prey to come to me.

This week I am keeping things short, but right now I am a little tired of doing too many things at my work as well as my personal life, hence expect some burst of articles in the next week.

## Created

- CRUD Application with Golang, Netlify Cloud Functions and Turso’s LibSQL Database:
    - [Part 1: Setup and Netlify project configuration](https://youtu.be/vlzGaBBkxYc?si=KTKxyKL5AwLnlAez)Double click to interact with video
    - [Part 2: Adding APIs and Templates for List and Create Link post form page](https://youtu.be/vlzGaBBkxYc?si=KTKxyKL5AwLnlAez)
    - [Part 3: Adding APIs for Edit and Deleting Links page](https://youtu.be/oBseflQiPJ8?si=T_R6yHBAV43FdNK1)

I didn’t create any videos the last week, however, this week, I was prepared and based on the things I created the last week, I combined together to make this video into 3 parts. More 2 parts will be coming in the next week.

## Read

- [How HTTPS Works Comic](https://howhttps.works/?ref=dailydev):
  This was a fun way to learn HTTP. It feels nice to read through the comic, nice visuals and extremely.
- [Doing hard things while living life - why we build vade studio in clojure](https://bytes.vadelabs.com/doing-hard-things-while-living-life-why-we-built-vade-studio-in-clojure/)
  Functional programming language might be something I would try out this year. I tried to do it some previous year, but life got me in the middle and had to get back to things. I want to learn a new language this year for sure.

## Watched

- [The PrimeAgen and Teej Devries with Mitchel Hshimoto (creator of Terraaform, Vagrant, Ghostty terminal, etc)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQnz7L6x068&pp=ygUYdGhlIHByaW1lYWdlbiBoYXNoaW5ubW90)Double click to interact with video
    - This was a great video, all nerds talking about Golang and Rust and Zig.
    - AI course, no one seems to be really against AI, its just not there yet, where one can just sit back and enjoy the view (or cry)
    - Deciding the programming language or tools first and then the project, is a bit wired, but I think it really depends on what type of mindset are we coming while building the project.

## Learnt

- Python is a mess
    - If I have a dictionary let’s say with some fields and one of the fields has value as None, now if try to access it it will give me none, I want to set the default value as something but it already has the value. This just makes me frustrate at points where it just doesn't;t make sense, the key is there but of null value, what is the purpose.
- Mongo DB > using find, find_one, regex, in operator and various queries.
- Golang > Iterators with slice range over.

## Tech News

- [Open AI launches operators](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10421097-operator): This is a launch of Kill One More SaaS. Not sure how many SaaS will freak out tomorrow. But it is game-changing and somewhat to keep an eye on and not let it slip through our lives, as this phase is revolutionary for sure.
- [DeepSeek R1 models](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120): Open Source and Cheaper Open AI’s alternative. This is a race of getting models to beat each other by accuracy or pricing by slight changes or improvements.
