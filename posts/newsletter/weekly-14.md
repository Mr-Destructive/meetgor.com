## Week #14

This was an excellent week, I created one video, posted one article, did a live stream setup went live for an hour on Twitch and Youtube, and did some exercise as well—writing of course with the 4th consecutive week.

The week was super-productive to start with, like I had a dream Sunday, I went on a walk in the morning, 6:30 AM, right? I have been procrastinating for months, but finally started doing since this Sunday. And I cannot say how much benefit I had from these walks like there is some energy flowing in me after I come from the walk. There is the fire ignited back, the curiosity flying back, the spark is back and with the habits like this newsletter and others in place, It looks like a dream routine, and it gets better and better. Not gonna Jinx it for the next week.

## Quote of the week

[This is a good read](https://www.wealest.com/articles/endurance), motivating to be honest. The start always is the least painful, we quite quickly pick a youtube video to watch but rarely finish it, quickly start with a new year resolution, and falter way too quickly (let’s do at least 2 weeks this year, come on), but the reward on enduring it and keeping up with it is quite a treat.

## Read

* [Using Go Embed](https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/go-embed): This is really handy and I just used it while researching and creating the video for SQLC. This was really a handy trick and feature in Go, to inject some raw strings or content from files, for instance, it helps in injecting the raw SQL queries from files to the golang program and executes them programmatically. This is commonly used with static files and templating as well I guess.
    
* [Taming the beast: Django ORM](https://www.davidhang.com/blog/2024-09-01-taming-the-django-orm/?ref=dailydev): Django is a beast when it comes to ORM, but I have started getting back from Django, as I don’t get to go a bit low-level, I can’t write raw SQL. But I am grateful and really happy that I started with Django, it helped me land my first internship and help me understand the terms in the tech. This was the major reason I started blogging and haven’t stopped since then. I went off on a tangent here, but Django ORM is great if you want to do something sophisticated with the data structures that would have in the database.
    

## Created

* Wrote: [Creating and Working with Embedded Replicas of LibSQL Database hosted on Turso in a Golang Project](https://www.meetgor.com/turso-libsql-embedded-replicas-golang/): I already have created a video on this, so just created an outline and wrote the article on my blog. I find this approach good, it helps me solidify the learnings from the knowledge that I gained from making the video and adding more examples and use-cases.
    
* Video: [Using SQLC with LibSQL Database in a Golang Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv1vCqUy_5o):  
    Created a video after 3 weeks, but felt good after creating this. This is the fourth video in the [Let’s Go with Turso](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMVgNvnU9WlE6H-Vk2gXq96bAkyNWXkNI&si=hiHaL1rI7Lv4Wmhf) Series.
    
* Blog: Created a blog for the writing that I have been doing for the past month. I don’t want to share it here, since that is not related to tech. I created a hugo site and added a blowfish theme to it, really got it right on the first try deploy to Cloudflare pages. In to the groove.  
    

## Watched

* [Github Copilot just dropped the bomb on AI Code editor startups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv1vCqUy_5o):
    

## Learned

* Using SQLC to generate go code from raw typed SQL. This is a great tool by the way, I really wanted to write SQL, but the frameworks and tools just make sure you don’t write the SQL yourselves, they generate them for you, which I appreciate that but also they should give the freedom to write raw SQL. SQLC is a really productive and awesome tool for SQL lovers (ORM Haters) and not for ORM lovers (Just kidding, it’s just a tool).
    
* You can embed some content from a file or any place with these `go:embed` tags, this is soo cool. I actually did it for embedding the RAW SQL queries for executing them in the SQLC library.
    

## Tech News

* [GitHub Universe 2024](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/universe-2024-previews-releases/): There is baggage to be unloaded here. Definitely a lot of AI, but also a lot of other stuff as well. I guess the AI hype is no more hype, it has become a reality, we need to accept it more I guess. But not blindly.
    
* [OpenAI launching ChatGPT Search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav): I mean Bing and Llama almost do this, so nothing fancy here, but the scale with ChatGPT would do it needs to be tested, seems a bit intriguing to be honest. This could be the tool that developers will use instead of Google search maybe in the next year. who knows?
