## Week #21

It was a nice week. I explored OpenAI stuff, fixed some issues in nested code structure, remade some Hugo sites, and did a bit of reading.

There were a lot of debugging sessions. I wanted to solve the advent of code but struggled for 10 days. Yes, and I have been struggling for 15 days at the blog event. I am still hoping to clear a few problems over the weekend. I am also looking to write some articles over the weekend. The weekend seems like a bit of high hope, but let’s see how much I can pull off. I also need to implement a quick project for my blog writing.

### Quote of the week

> – Confucius

This is me speaking, to say that I am slow at solving the advent of code, but still haven’t quit yet. I will be there slowly. I won’t stop, this weekend I will try to get through some backlogs.

- [Day 3 of Advent of Code 2024 in Golang](https://youtu.be/nhueQbOKdTs?si=IPbWkfloOvPVhF6c)  
  This was the do and don’t multiply expression problem. It was a good problem, and I solved it with a different approach of using enabled and disabled portions of strings to strip off the disabled strings and then use the part one logic for the actual answer.Double click to interact with video

## Read

- [The Curse of Markdown](https://codehike.org/blog/the-curse-of-markdown?ref=dailydev)
  It was a nice article, I agree that a few blogs are lying between markdown and rich content. I also love to express ideas that markdown might limit.
- [The Golang 1.24 release is looking seriously awesome](https://devcenter.upsun.com/posts/go-124/?ref=dailydev)  
  I don’t think this is a big release, yes there are a few cool little things that are added up in the standard library. But nothing groundbreaking as the 1.23 and 1.21 releases.
- [Surely not all codes’s worth it](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/surely-not-all-codes-worth-it)
  This is to the point, I would like to write the code that matters and leave the rest to LLM to generate because it’s not worth the time for me to write everything. I still want to write the stuff that might be oblivious because I have not written it yet in my life, I would like to fail and still try again.[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-2HZ!,w_56,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff114450f-2313-48c6-a253-a1d476c21d93_1164x1164.png)Register SpillSurely not all code's worth itListen to this: “I don’t use AI for programming, because I want to learn and get better at programming and if I have an LLM generate code for me, I’m not learning anything…Read more7 months ago · 29 likes · 10 comments · Thorsten Ball](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/surely-not-all-codes-worth-it?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web)
- [The premise trap: DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-premise-trap-924b8cd9):

This is relatable, I can’t actually comment here, I am a junior but yes working with a AI chatbot/assistant is frustrating as hell sometimes, sometimes it is refreshing. I believe it will be a skill to work with LLMs in few years. I admire Simon Wilson for this, he just tries wild things to make it work for him.

- [Year in Review: Dev Agarwal](https://devagr.me/blog/senior):

This was a heart-touching review, I can relate to it, you will have everything before there will be nothing. This is the cycle, life is a miss and a bliss. There will be times you jump ahead in the day, but there will be times when you will struggle to wake up, even fear to live, but it is the one who goes through it and still does it anyway.

- [Shilin's Second Year without a job](https://shilin.ca/my-second-year-without-job/):
  This was a surprising read, I can’t believe that it is possible to live life without having a consistent stream of income. I just feel it is not for me and my lifestyle, I can’t live like that.

## Watched

- [Golang | Remix | Pocketbase in a single binary](https://youtu.be/j8vVKKojuj0?si=PgdntgcTrh1rwJHK)
  THis is fascinating, it will make things so simple, just like the philosophy of Go. Make and Keep it simple, whom are you trying to complicate for? yourself in few months, years?Double click to interact with video

## Learnt

- [About batch calls in OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch/getting-started?lang=node)

This is good only for some specific tasks, it could be useful for scrapping and getting certain things for the day. It has 24 hours of turnaround time, which means it could return anywhere between 1 second to 24 hours, it will respond late obliviously, essentially it will wait for less peak hours and traffic time to respond to the request.

- [Using tiktoken to count the number of Tokens](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken)
  I learned this to calculate the number of tokens in a particular set of requirements, which is basically some sort of cost analysis.
