 I agree to this post, when I didn't had the phone, I was much creative, much more bored. 
 I don't know if it was just that or it feels life was filled with much more satisfaction and bonding.
 
 People including me have become a bit too distant, too focused on productivity. There are too many things to serve ourselves with, reducing the interactions, the wait, the memories.
 
 Yes, we need to bring friction back in our lives.
