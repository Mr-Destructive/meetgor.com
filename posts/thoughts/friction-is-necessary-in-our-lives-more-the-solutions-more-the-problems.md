<p>I agree to this post, when I didn't had the phone, I was much creative, much more bored.
I don't know if it was just that or it feels life was filled with much more satisfaction and bonding.</p>
<p>People including me have become a bit too distant, too focused on productivity. There are too many things to serve ourselves with, reducing the interactions, the wait, the memories.</p>
<p>Yes, we need to bring friction back in our lives.</p>
