<h2>Week #9</h2>
<p>This week was a bit of refreshing as I was able to write some code, bunch of experimentation and feeling a bit back after some slump in the past week. Need to get one video out this weekend to get into the habit. This October I will be trying to build my own writing routine, it won’t be for technical articles, but I won’t be surprised if I find it helpful to write more technical articles.</p>
<p>This week, I had times where I said, I can still solve problems, Look LLMs you are still idiot. The next day, it just helped me just a function with some function signature and proper data type of parameters and return value. I am not saying, LLMs are complete idiots, but they don’t have sense what they are talking about, they sound like they have, but no, sorry. I would love to improve my productivity, by that I mean to speed up my process for searching, copy pasting from elsewhere, scrambling all over the internet to understand something. It just is like a little pipeline, I throw at it some things, If it makes sense to me, I accept, else I trash it, back to old ways.</p>

<p>I will be making up for the <a href="https://techstructively.substack.com/p/techstructive-weekly-8">last week</a> slump, I said in the quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow”</p>
<p>— Mary Anne Radmacher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here I am proving it, I am excited to get into the weekend, pumped up and ready for a change in habits and routine. Last week I was frustrated, maybe burned out, I practically didn’t do anything last weekend, but I din’t quit, I said will be back next week.</p>
<p>Actually last week I had my convocation, I remembered it now. The Saturday, the whole day went in that, hanging out with friends, maybe for the last time officially. It feels a bit bitter-sweet that I completed 4 years of the degree college.</p>
<h2>Quote of the week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;&quot;Fall seven times, stand up eight.&quot;<br>
— Japanese Proverb</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The past few weeks were tough for me, not as any bad thing, but just things are bit off for me. This week, I still showed up and tackled every thing that came my way, successful or not, I am still standing and doing the thing I love, debugging code :)</p>
<p>Keep walking</p>

<p><a href="https://generativeai.pub/generating-music-using-ai-and-python-d47ab834f0d4"><strong>Generating music with AI and Python</strong></a> : I actually went ahead and tried a few words to check that out. It actually creates some sound, though it takes time and is bit off track and I actually don’t know what would be the right words for that music that comes to my mind, so I would be experimenting with it just for fun.</p>

<p><strong>The New Era of Writing Code</strong>: This is so relatable, I was just using some AI to wire up some functions and making it easier at certain task, but worse at the other, I won’t be surprised to see something like a AI Stack in the upcoming months, Like a set of Models, Providers, templates and prompt cheat sheet for developers and other tasks.</p>

<h2>Watched</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chat with DHH, TJ Devries and The Primeagen</strong>:<br>
This is worth the 2 hours. I would say that much, it is fun and at the same time, so much value for a junior as well any software developer (leaving out the kids part XD)</p>

<p><strong>Mult DB Schema in Turso</strong><br>
Learn how to create child databases from a parent database keeping the same schema, using Turso CLI, this will make any changes on schema of parent db get reflected on the child db.</p>

<h2>Learnt</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/docs/DOCKER.md">Setup a</a> <code>sqld</code> <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/docs/DOCKER.md">server with docker</a>: I was checking out SQLD, a server daemon for LibSQL, a SQLite fork database. This is really handy for connecting a sqlite-like database over the network. I am using docker for running it locally and it is a breeze to set it up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ollama.com/blog/llama3.2">Download LLMs locally with ollama</a>: I was quite impressed by the speed of the LLAMA 3.2 1B model. It worked smoothly, on my 8GB laptop. This would be quite handy in case of network issues, vendor outages and other politics.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/">LLM package in python by Simon Wilson</a>: This is neat and handy for experimenting and playing around with sophisticated techniques to solve certain problems or even debugging certain hands on problems.</p>
