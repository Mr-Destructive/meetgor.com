<h2>Week #11</h2>
<p>This week was good in terms of writing. I started a new endeavor: a blog. It is not technical; it is related to mythology and finding its meaning in the modern world. I kept a consistent writing routine for nine days. Nine posts in nine days looks like a good start for my writing routine. I will try to continue this routine throughout the month.</p>
<p>Moving on to the technical things, I wrote a lot less code than usual but read a lot of code for debugging and understanding existing flows.</p>

<h2>Quote of the week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.&quot;</em></p>
<p>— Albert Schweitzer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Success is the goal, and happiness is the process. If one can be happy in the process, it is already a great journey. Love the craft not the goal.</p>
<h2>Read</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://roman.pt/posts/dont-let-dicts-spoil-your-code/">Refrain from the usage of dicts in the business logic in Python</a>:<br>
I agree with this point, because the way dicts behave in complex structured code mess, is really hard to debug and trace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html">What is new in Python 3.13</a>:<br>
This is a big release in Python. It actually revamped the REPL experience to a new level. There is also the experimental addition of the JIT compiler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data model behind the Notion’s flexibility:<br>
The component-based model for Notion suits it really well. They used the right tools and architecture for the right job.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Watched</h2>
<ul>
<li>Communication in Engineering is vital, if technical skills are important then soft skills are the most important thing to have as a software engineer. If you can’t understandably express your thoughts, that could be a bit disadvantage to be honest. I personally struggle with this, I can communicate, but I am bit bad at it, I am trying to improve my vocal ability to express what is in my head effectively. I can write my thoughts really well, but when it comes to speaking, its a bit hard for me.</li>
