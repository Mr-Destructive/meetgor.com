<h2>Week #13</h2>
<p>This was a pretty rough week, some mundane tasks at work, not that mundane but felt off track on the mind. Nothing going on in my life, just that the past things that have happened have slowed down and now feel the sense of pain and consequences in the future. Don’t know what I am talking really, but as always there is hope in me, I am continuing to write a mythological blog of mine for almost 21 days which is 3 weeks, yes that is a daily one post. At least some things in life are good.</p>
<p>Related to technical stuff, I was off from mental creativity for most of the week, feeling drained and wrenched.</p>
<p>However, I did complete a non-fiction, non-technical book through the past weekend, and felt good reading that.</p>
<h2>Quote of the week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sometimes, when things are falling apart, they may actually be falling into place”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just my life right now, I don’t know anything happening to me right now, I am just waking up and banging in the day with a pinch of salt to survive, that is not the right mentality I know, but there’s a fear of burnout and losing the job at hand in this tough times, so just keeping the grind on is the solution for me I guess.</p>
<p>I can just hope to fall in place, things are messy but from the overall picture of life, I hope they are heading towards where they should be.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://x.com/MeetGor21/status/1849125774277697849">Quote tweet by me</a>, sums up my technical writing routine slump</p>
<h2>Read</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sotergreco.com/what-10000-hours-of-coding-taught-me-dont-ship-fast?ref=dailydev">What 100 coding taught me</a>: I felt the article was a bit off-track by introducing code samples, that could have been simplified, but such is the complexity of developers’ life, can’t simplify complex things as they are indeed complex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-i-cured-procrastination/">How I cured my procrastination</a>: This feels like an epidemic of happiness, the enthusiasm and humility in the author’s words are evident and make you jump out of the procrastination loop hell. Worth reading.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Watched</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Git reset vs Git revert:<br>
This is really well explained, I never have thought or discovered that these things also exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git Bisect</p>
<p>Never found a situation to use this, but man, this would be soo handy to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best Engineering interview question I’ve ever gotten:<br>
This was a reaction of the MemSQL multiply command or functionality addition in the C codebase with time constraints, It was really not challenging but would make a lot of things clear and open about the developer in an interview.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Learnt</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learned about Exponential Backoff: It is like a retry strategy that gradually increases the wait time between attempts to reduce system load and improve stability, often doubling the delay after each failed try. I used it to try out OpenAI API calls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tech News</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use">Claude</a> Bombs tech with its Computer Use: This is like an automation testing tool with AI, I would say. Testing tools like selenium or hardcoded replay stuff, but this is the evolution of those tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://turso.tech/launch-week">Turso with its Launch Week 3</a>: Embedding support, No Cold starts, 7 SDKs added, Offline writes, this is a banger of a launch week from Turso, taking SQLite to the moon! (It actually is used already)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://turbot.com/blog/2024/10/launch-week-6-wrap">Turbot with its Launch Week 6</a>: A great launch week for TUrbot with the v1.0 release for all flagship products like steampipe, flowpipe, and powerpipe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/blog/conference-product-releases">Notion Releases Email, Forms, Layouts, Automation</a>: I think this usually doesn’t work out well for companies or products, but Notion just might pull it off, something about them is aesthetically pleasing but speed is bugging me to use it.</p>
