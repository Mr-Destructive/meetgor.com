<h2>Week #8</h2>
<p>This week was quite a slow one for me, I didn’t write much code, but I did some thinking and debugging deep into configurations. I want to say this, that’s it, not in the mood for a rant this week.</p>
<h2>Quote of the week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.’”</p>
<p>— Mary Anne Radmacher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote is really apt for the week for me, I actually had no or very little progress this week, maybe I was a little distracted with life, but that doesn’t mean I quit this newsletter, I will show up, I will write it even I have nothing to write, When I read this in the future, I will be proud when I wrote when no one was reading, no one was watching me. I will try again next week.</p>
