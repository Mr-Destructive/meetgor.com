<p>This was a pretty rough week, some mundane tasks at work, not that mundane but felt off track on the mind. Nothing going on in my life, just that the past things that have happened have slowed down and now feel the sense of pain and consequences in the future. Don’t know what I am talking really, but as always there is hope in me, I am continuing to write a mythological blog of mine for almost 21 days which is 3 weeks, yes that is a daily one post. At least some things in life are good.</p>
<p>Related to technical stuff, I was off from mental creativity for most of the week, feeling drained and wrenched.</p>
<p>However, I did complete a non-fiction, non-technical book through the past weekend, and felt good reading that.</p>
<h2 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the week</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sometimes, when things are falling apart, they may actually be falling into place”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just my life right now, I don’t know anything happening to me right now, I am just waking up and banging in the day with a pinch of salt to survive, that is not the right mentality I know, but there’s a fear of burnout and losing the job at hand in this tough times, so just keeping the grind on is the solution for me I guess.</p>
<p>I can just hope to fall in place, things are messy but from the overall picture of life, I hope they are heading towards where they should be.</p>

<p>Git reset vs Git revert:<br>
This is really well explained, I never have thought or discovered that these things also exist.</p>

<p>Git Bisect</p>
<p>Never found a situation to use this, but man, this would be soo handy to know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best Engineering interview question I’ve ever gotten:<br>
This was a reaction of the MemSQL multiply command or functionality addition in the C codebase with time constraints, It was really not challenging but would make a lot of things clear and open about the developer in an interview.</p>
