However, life is pushing me in a different direction, and I am so confused. I have responsibilities to perform and situations to tackle. It is a bit hard to live ahead, but I will stay with my three pillars: curiosity, consistency, and grit.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This week, I created one video, and that’s it. It was just a bit of a hectic weekend, so I didn’t have much free time. However, on weekdays, I was able to learn about subdomains, LLMs, and more. I read a lot about writing, and at this point, I am overwhelmed with writing advice. I think it is high time to write consistently.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h3 id=\u0026#34;quote-of-the-week\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Quote of the week\u0026lt;\/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;“\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nEvery accomplishment starts with the decision to try.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\n”\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\n— Gail Devers\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I feel a bit overwhelmed as to what should I be doing, I have so many things going on:\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;100 Days of Golang (38 articles completed)\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Youtube Channel (~50 subscribers) | 20 videos\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Writing Novels (soo many ideas, overwhelmed to start on one)\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Each idea requires some intense planning and execution steps, however, I work full-time as a software developer, which is also a mentally draining process. Managing all of these things at once will burn me out instantly, but have kept pace for the past 6 months, and continue to do so. However, I want to make it a bit structured and habitual rather than a hap-hazard way of poking everything at once, which ends up having nothing accomplished and still burned out.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I took that quote and rambled, but I need to pick direction now, I have a sense of speed, but the direction is more important here. I will be analyzing where I will be heading this year this week.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2 id=\u0026#34;created\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Created\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/youtu.be\/-uNWDCr9mMk?si=ek92CeDVpa2h9wfC\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Turso CLI Guide\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;: Interacting with LibSQL databases on the Turso platform\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;I just created the first video on ShotCut tool, a local video editor. I have been using Clipchamp for video editing, this was the first video created on Shotcut.Double click to interact with video\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;No streams the previous weekend, I didn’t stream for the first time in I guess 12 weeks. I started in November and did it constantly for the past 3 months, and broke the streak the previous weekend. I was out of energy and had to go out for several hours, so ended up not doing the streams.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I will be doing one this weekend though.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2 id=\u0026#34;read\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Read\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/pointersgonewild.com\/2025-01-10-so-i-rolled-my-own-static-site-generator\/?ref=dailydev\u0026#34;\u0026gt;So I rolled my own Static Site generator\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;: This is an interesting read, I also touched on static site generators in Golang through live streams. I didn’t write the markdown parser for now, I am planning to do it at some point. I really want to understand how parsers work, I thought that was not the right time to write my own markdown parser, so just used a library.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/dev.to\/holasoymalva\/how-serverless-is-killing-the-traditional-backend-role-2ff2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;How Serverless is killing the traditional backend role\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;: I agree with this, the backend developer role is shifting towards DevOps and Operations oriented tasks rather than writing from scratch things. This will rapidly evolve in my opinion with LLMs writing the code and at some point, the backend will just be a black box that is hardly touched with code, just a few knobs and switches to make changes.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/jarosz.dev\/article\/how-to-write-better-tests-in-go\/\u0026#34;\u0026gt;How to write better tests in Go\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;: This was a nice overview of how to structure tests and the mindset of writing test cases.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/blog.stackademic.com\/top-10-clean-code-rules-831fb34caff7\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Top 10 Clean Code Rules\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;: This was also an insightful read, specifically writing the positive conditionals instead of negative ones is so relatable and correct in many ways. The code should be simple to read, I can feel how much I have to stress and put a thought when determining the correct condition when the negation is introduced in the condition.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2 id=\u0026#34;watched\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Watched\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Memory management Course from Boot.dev by Teej Devries\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nI am watching this course and so far it looks dope. The time that TJ has put in will be gold, I am also planning to take the course on boot.dev.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Double click to interact with video\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Alpine JS by Dreams of Code:\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nThis was a great crash course on Alpine JS, I think I might use it for creating web apps where I need some interactivity without writing javascript, htmx is good, but yes interactivity is done with Alpine JS.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Double click to interact with video\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2 id=\u0026#34;learned\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Learned\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Tina CMS setup: I set up the dev.meetgor.com with TIna, it is a work in progress. I have learned quite a few things, and want to create videos and articles about it, but can’t find the right mental space to do things like this. I also created AI agents with langgraph, but have not gotten a free mental space to jot the learnings together.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/support.hostinger.com\/en\/articles\/8907694-how-to-create-a-subdomain-without-a-hosting-plan\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Setup subdomains on Hostinger with a Domain-only Plan\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;: I was reading a blog of an author and found some hiccups on their website, some missing links, and redirects, this made me wander to the domain world. I began searching for domains, subdomains, and free hosting. I finally ended up at \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/support.hostinger.com\/en\/articles\/8907694-how-to-create-a-subdomain-without-a-hosting-plan\u0026#34;\u0026gt;this\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt; article, and it opened a huge world of possibilities, I had the ability to create subdomains on my domain meetgor.com, but never knew that I thought to do that, I had to purchase the hosting plan. Very nice marketing by Hostinger, clever. But, I am a developer and searching is my weapon.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2 id=\u0026#34;tech-news\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Tech News\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/github.blog\/news-insights\/product-news\/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens\/\u0026#34;\u0026gt;GitHub Copilot Agent\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;: This looks like an actual agent for an editor\/IDE. Yes, developers are on the verge of getting jobless (I think I have heard that for quite some time now), where is Devin, he might be scared!\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/blog.google\/technology\/google-deepmind\/gemini-model-updates-february-2025\/\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Gemini 2.0 is Generally available\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;: I have read this a much more better and cheaper model then it’s competitors. But the only reason I am afraid of its adoption is google’s ability to throw it in the graveyard. I have seen bard go that route as well, so I no more trust Google on the product’s reliability.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thanks for reading Techstructive Weekly!

                <h2 id="week-28">Week #28</h2>
<p>This week was a bit frustrating, but I really want to continue what I am working on. However, life is pushing me in a different direction, and I am so confused. I have responsibilities to perform and situations to tackle. It is a bit hard to live ahead, but I will stay with my three pillars: curiosity, consistency, and grit.</p>
<p>This week, I created one video, and that’s it. It was just a bit of a hectic weekend, so I didn’t have much free time. However, on weekdays, I was able to learn about subdomains, LLMs, and more. I read a lot about writing, and at this point, I am overwhelmed with writing advice. I think it is high time to write consistently.</p>
<h3 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the week</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“<br>
Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.<br>
”<br>
— Gail Devers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel a bit overwhelmed as to what should I be doing, I have so many things going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 Days of Golang (38 articles completed)</li>
<li>Youtube Channel (~50 subscribers) | 20 videos</li>
<li>Writing Novels (soo many ideas, overwhelmed to start on one)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each idea requires some intense planning and execution steps, however, I work full-time as a software developer, which is also a mentally draining process. Managing all of these things at once will burn me out instantly, but have kept pace for the past 6 months, and continue to do so. However, I want to make it a bit structured and habitual rather than a hap-hazard way of poking everything at once, which ends up having nothing accomplished and still burned out.</p>
<p>I took that quote and rambled, but I need to pick direction now, I have a sense of speed, but the direction is more important here. I will be analyzing where I will be heading this year this week.</p>

<p>No streams the previous weekend, I didn’t stream for the first time in I guess 12 weeks. I started in November and did it constantly for the past 3 months, and broke the streak the previous weekend. I was out of energy and had to go out for several hours, so ended up not doing the streams.</p>
<p>I will be doing one this weekend though.</p>
<h2 id="read">Read</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pointersgonewild.com/2025-01-10-so-i-rolled-my-own-static-site-generator/?ref=dailydev">So I rolled my own Static Site generator</a>: This is an interesting read, I also touched on static site generators in Golang through live streams. I didn’t write the markdown parser for now, I am planning to do it at some point. I really want to understand how parsers work, I thought that was not the right time to write my own markdown parser, so just used a library.</li>
<li><a href="https://dev.to/holasoymalva/how-serverless-is-killing-the-traditional-backend-role-2ff2">How Serverless is killing the traditional backend role</a>: I agree with this, the backend developer role is shifting towards DevOps and Operations oriented tasks rather than writing from scratch things. This will rapidly evolve in my opinion with LLMs writing the code and at some point, the backend will just be a black box that is hardly touched with code, just a few knobs and switches to make changes.</li>
<li><a href="https://jarosz.dev/article/how-to-write-better-tests-in-go/">How to write better tests in Go</a>: This was a nice overview of how to structure tests and the mindset of writing test cases.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.stackademic.com/top-10-clean-code-rules-831fb34caff7">Top 10 Clean Code Rules</a>: This was also an insightful read, specifically writing the positive conditionals instead of negative ones is so relatable and correct in many ways. The code should be simple to read, I can feel how much I have to stress and put a thought when determining the correct condition when the negation is introduced in the condition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="watched">Watched</h2>
<ul>
<li>Memory management Course from Boot.dev by Teej Devries<br>
I am watching this course and so far it looks dope. The time that TJ has put in will be gold, I am also planning to take the course on boot.dev.</li>
</ul>
<p>Double click to interact with video</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpine JS by Dreams of Code:<br>
This was a great crash course on Alpine JS, I think I might use it for creating web apps where I need some interactivity without writing javascript, htmx is good, but yes interactivity is done with Alpine JS.</li>

<h2 id="learned">Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tina CMS setup: I set up the dev.meetgor.com with TIna, it is a work in progress. I have learned quite a few things, and want to create videos and articles about it, but can’t find the right mental space to do things like this. I also created AI agents with langgraph, but have not gotten a free mental space to jot the learnings together.</li>
<li><a href="https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/8907694-how-to-create-a-subdomain-without-a-hosting-plan">Setup subdomains on Hostinger with a Domain-only Plan</a>: I was reading a blog of an author and found some hiccups on their website, some missing links, and redirects, this made me wander to the domain world. I began searching for domains, subdomains, and free hosting. I finally ended up at <a href="https://support.hostinger.com/en/articles/8907694-how-to-create-a-subdomain-without-a-hosting-plan">this</a> article, and it opened a huge world of possibilities, I had the ability to create subdomains on my domain meetgor.com, but never knew that I thought to do that, I had to purchase the hosting plan. Very nice marketing by Hostinger, clever. But, I am a developer and searching is my weapon.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-the-agent-awakens/">GitHub Copilot Agent</a>: This looks like an actual agent for an editor/IDE. Yes, developers are on the verge of getting jobless (I think I have heard that for quite some time now), where is Devin, he might be scared!</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/">Gemini 2.0 is Generally available</a>: I have read this a much more better and cheaper model then it’s competitors. But the only reason I am afraid of its adoption is google’s ability to throw it in the graveyard. I have seen bard go that route as well, so I no more trust Google on the product’s reliability.</li>
