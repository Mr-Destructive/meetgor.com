With the rise of Agentic IDEs (yes, that is a deliberate buzzword, I am using) like Windsurf, Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, Claude code, Warp, Amp code, whatever agent in the loop.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I am not saying any of those are good or bad, they have their own quirks and preferences. Just like I love Vim and you hate it, or loving VS Co**. Maybe that war would happen to some extent, but developers, we are in crisis. No time to have text-editor wars. Because the craft is at stake.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I am very naive here, you can stop reading this and save your time, maybe it\u0026#39;s a rambling. Because AI companies and any software company are using AI to write code, forcing developers to use AI tools without it, you are doing a disservice to the company. Which I am very much against.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you had told a labourer to use machines instead of their hands, they would have loved to. But if you ask an artist to use robotic bots to create art, you are not doing justice. Because developers are not labourers, they are artists. Developers don\u0026#39;t use physical energy, they use cognitive energy to solve (and create) problems.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It\u0026#39;s a bit harsh reality that I am trying to accept, but I can\u0026#39;t. I can\u0026#39;t let an LLM with some tools write code for me, that is my part. I love that, I am not saying I don\u0026#39;t like to solve problems, but if solving problems is the idea, then writing code is the execution and its fruit. If I give the problem to AI, with some prompt magic, and even if it writes the code and the problem is solved, I don\u0026#39;t feel fulfilled, I don\u0026#39;t get any value, I don\u0026#39;t love that process. Yes, I can review the code and make changes, but who in the world loves reviewing code? Do you love reviewing peers\u0026#39; PRs? really?\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I am not against this change, I would love to use LLMs in my workflow, 100%. But it\u0026#39;s far than that, companies have started to consider this a productive compulsion, instead of a tool. They expect things to be done 2x faster. Things that could be done in a week can be wrapped in 3 days. That is cool, but not effective for sustainability, there are limits to how much a developer can think and spend their mental ability. Writing prompts and thinking with the LLM drains a lot of it, because it is quick.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I am not sure if I am correct, but that\u0026#39;s my thought. I love Agentic IDEs, but hate when companies start using them as a productivity booster all the time. I need some way to express my art, but AI has snatched it from me.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Wired Times, 2025, please have mercy in the second half. You had us in the first half.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n"
