      <title>2024: Year Review</title>
      <link>meetgor.com/2024-review</link>
      <description>A developer retrospective of the year 2024. A reflection of the goals that I worked towards in tech as a developer. Created tech YouTube channel and a weekly newsletter in later second half of the year, got a full time software developer job, and learned a ton of things.</description>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <content>&#xA;## Introduction&#xA;&#xA;It is the end of the year, and I write this yearly as I have been writing it since [2022](https://www.meetgor.com/tag/developer-life/). I get a lot of insights on the things after writing them. Let‚Äôs dive in for my journey from intern to full-time backend developer.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; ‚Äú2024, You had me in the first half‚Äù&#xA;&#xA;No jokes here, I was scared as shit till May 31st, something special happened on May 31st, 2024 in my life!&#xA;&#xA;Well, I got a full-time offer letter and the results of my bachelor‚Äôs degree which I passed with an 8.9 CGPA (not good but not bad either). If someone had to tell me an hour could change your life then this would be the day, exactly between 5 and 6 in the evening, I went from dropped shoulders to the happiest person in the world.&#xA;&#xA;I can‚Äôt describe that feeling; it has a special place in my heart. From June 2023 to May 2024, I faced rejections left and right, but there was hope, a flicker of fire left that carried me here. I went from having nothing to being overwhelmed by so many great things that happened to me.&#xA;&#xA;I am grateful to my parents, family, manager, friends, and Mother Nature for blessing me with whatever I receive in 2024 ü•π&#xA;&#xA;### Gist&#xA;&#xA;It was a good year, I learned a lot. I can say confidently I am more mature than I was a year ago. The year 2023 was a bit harsh for me, especially in the end, but that continued the effects for some time in 2024 as well. However, as I said, that single hour changed my life in a good way.&#xA;&#xA;I became more of a problem thinker than a software developer, I was solving real-life problems at work. I faced challenges and failed at times, but I reflected, learned from them, and moved ahead. This is the aim of this post as well. I want to learn from this year. It feels overwhelming at first, but if I put it word by word, sentence by sentence, then it becomes crystal clear where I shined and where I fumbled, and the holes in the wall.&#xA;&#xA;I feel like the first half of 2024 was the test of my patience and consistency. I was interning at Docsumo, I was assigned the task of one specific feature, then I got a few more tasks simultaneously and kept on chipping in bug fixes and understanding of the codebase, which by the end of one quarter I was given the sole responsibility of maintenance. That was not as boring as you might expect, it was challenging, it was about thinking through edge cases and solving the issues that the users were facing. This helped me develop my problem-solving skills and improve my communication skills.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;## Lessons learned&#xA;&#xA;- Hard work pays off, it might take time, but it does, patience is the key&#xA;- Things can change in an instance, don&#39;t wait for the right/perfect time, make every second count&#xA;- People are going to judge anyway, so don&#39;t hold back on the things that you wish to do, and don&#39;t let that fear hold you&#xA;- Writing is one of the things that can make your thoughts and impact immortal (to some extent)&#xA;&#xA;I won&#39;t leave this article without a quote or two, I really think quotes can change your perspective of life (not all obviously, but some)&#xA;&#xA;&gt; &#34;Do one thing every day that scares you&#34;&#xA;&gt; -- Eleanor Roosevelt&#xA;&#xA;I started recording videos, recording the voice-over (yikes, I hated my voice for the initial few videos, I still hate it, but have gotten used to it).&#xA;I don&#39;t just say, I do! Or I do and then say like this article üòé&#xA;&#xA;One more, please?&#xA;&#xA;&gt; &#34;It&#39;s not the years in your life that count. It&#39;s the life in your years.&#34; &#xA;&gt; -- Abraham Lincoln&#xA;&#xA;This is how I feel right now, I overcame one obstacle in my life, and the other is right here waiting for me to shoot down. You can&#39;t wait for life to ease out for you, you will have to find happiness in the hardships and highs and lows in your life.&#xA;&#xA;## Achievements&#xA;&#xA;* Land a full-time offer as a junior backend developer at [Docsumo](https://www.docsumo.com/)&#xA;    &#xA;* Started a YouTube channel, despite fear and doubts&#xA;    &#xA;* Started a [Tech Newsletter](https://techstructively.substack.com/) (summary of my learnings) with 23 editions written in 23 weeks&#xA;    &#xA;* Created a writing routine for 50 days (wrote some literature/philosophical-related articles)&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;I feel good, but there is a mountain to climb. It is a marathon, not a sprint. I am excited about the year ahead, all the things I will learn, what responsibilities will be given, and will I make new connections in tech.&#xA;&#xA;## Technical Retrospective&#xA;&#xA;I would like to view the year into the things I created namely the blogs and the video that I made.&#xA;&#xA;### Articles Written&#xA;&#xA;This could have been better but still managed to write around 13 articles (excluding this), about Cody setup in Neovim, Nginx basics, Golang HTTP POST and PUT methods, Advent of Code approach and solutions in Golang.&#xA;&#xA;* [Configuring Sourcegraph‚Äôs Cody in Neovim](https://www.meetgor.com/neovim-sourcegraph-cody/)&#xA;    &#xA;* [NGINX Survival Guide](https://www.meetgor.com/series/nginx-survival-guide/)&#xA;    &#xA;* [100 Days of Golang](https://www.meetgor.com/series/100-days-of-golang/): Edition 34th and 35th Article about [POST](https://www.meetgor.com/golang-web-post-method/) and [PUT](https://www.meetgor.com/golang-web-put-method/) method&#xA;    &#xA;* Using LibSQL Database in Golang: [Connection](https://www.meetgor.com/turso-libsql-db-golang/) and using [Embedded Replicas](https://www.meetgor.com/turso-libsql-embedded-replicas-golang/)&#xA;    &#xA;* [Safely using Maps in Golang: The difference between declaration and initialization](https://www.meetgor.com/golang-safely-using-maps/)&#xA;    &#xA;* [Advent of Code, 2024 in Golang](https://www.meetgor.com/series/advent-of-code-2024/): Approach and Solution Explanation (till day 5, might write a few more, have some rough drafts to be completed)&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;### Youtube Channel&#xA;&#xA;On September 9th I published my first YouTube video, I always wanted to create some tutorial about the things I know or want to learn. On that day, I kept my doubts and fears aside and hit the record button. It went bad, but I published the video. It took me roughly 5 hours to record the voice-over for a 6-minute video, I was in shambles after that. I then decided to double down on creating YouTube videos, to remove my fear of communicating, speaking, and expressing ideas and emotions through YouTube. And after 4 months, I have published around 14 videos. Not only that, I started to do live streams on weekends as well. I did around 16 live streams on Twitch and YouTube, I feel a lot better and a lot more confident.&#xA;&#xA;And yes the time required for me to create a video, record voice-over, and do the editing is significantly improving with each video, the last video I posted of 50 minutes, I recorded within an hour, one shot, and the next hour, the video was published. If I am the only person to benefit from my videos, then so be it.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Here is the summary of the videos I made from September to December:&#xA;&#xA;* Using Turso LibSQL Database in Golang \[[remote-connection](https://youtu.be/vBrvX0X0phw?si=eEDV_qa9uXqI_vyK)\] \[[embedded replicas](https://youtu.be/BitxB40rdVw?si=E3KK1hoGf1hY0klq)\] \[[libsql local server](https://youtu.be/rIXePHhdUSI?si=IYk9A4zpBvr9pILf)\]&#xA;    &#xA;* Using [Goose](https://youtu.be/9kMeb7d2id8?si=FHyFKcXme8WyFij_) and [SQLC](https://youtu.be/mv1vCqUy_5o?si=dG25tC1U_zsoAhPd) with LibSQL in a Golang Application&#xA;    &#xA;* [Deploying Netlify cloud functions in Golang](https://youtu.be/BY2Z2Em7OdA?si=u2zjCWoOOI4wRivC)&#xA;    &#xA;* What‚Äôs new in Golang 1.24 \[[SplitSeq](https://youtu.be/hee9KUhvQsY?si=FqhGRXbhKOgPrVLj)\] \[[Omit Zero JSON Tag](https://youtu.be/RFUz4_axOZg?si=88iUnjGBKCx_fFiv)\]&#xA;    &#xA;* Advent of Code \[[day-1](https://youtu.be/4U97gLyz0Ss?si=vxfmbQxaaUf1GRmk)\] \[[day-2](https://youtu.be/jGrPkldp4rY?si=Brdb1ulBYwUfXr7F)\] \[[day-3](https://youtu.be/nhueQbOKdTs?si=MjHPXbKoCml5x-Ut)\] \[[day-4](https://youtu.be/029R_DKLqko?si=Iv5rVD_meKlXbMJs)\] \[[day-5](https://youtu.be/7pl7WRmfepQ?si=QdGigfhn04rSUEp4)\] ‚Ä¶ ran out of time&#xA;&#xA;I just have only 50 odd subscribers and a couple of thousand views, it is just the start, and I am not looking into the metrics right now, surely I am trying to improve and build a community, but numbers don&#39;t mean anything to me right now at least. I am creating videos that I would like to watch myself if I hadn&#39;t known about the concepts that I once didn&#39;t knew.&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;### Open Source Contributions&#xA;&#xA;I wanted to do many more open-source contributions, but since I worked on creating YouTube videos, I didn‚Äôt get much headspace to work on them. Next year I want to create some form a habit to read some code, that way I know I will bang my head to fix the issues or discover something new. Creating a chain of exploring, learning, and contributing.&#xA;&#xA;* Minor additions on [steampipe](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe/pull/4315) and [turso-cli](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso-cli/pull/815) repositories&#xA;    - Added CSV flag for separator in db create command&#xA;    - Fix the bug for only showing timing when verbose flag is set&#xA;&#xA;### Projects Created&#xA;&#xA;I created a few projects, some of them just to explore the technologies and little MVPs, one project that I can be open to showing is the [Outsmarty](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/outsmarty) project. This project is like a Psyche Clone in Golang, it‚Äôs not a mobile application, it is a web app. I have not completed it as usual but it is a good concept that I created till most of the heavy lifting, I usually quit at the frontend interfaces.&#xA;&#xA;## Non-Technical Stuff&#xA;&#xA;I was really into writing and reading in the second half of the year. I decided to create a morning routine for a couple of weeks, but Indian parents, had to put that routine into trash can, but it was a good experience while it lasted.&#xA;&#xA;* Read 6 books \[[GoodReads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82596574-meet)\]&#xA;    &#xA;* Wrote [50 Posts](https://mythstomeaning.substack.com/) about mythology and philosophy&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;Hopefully, as I carry forward this momentum and energy, I will likely have one novella completed this year. I not just hoping to do that I am planning it now.&#xA;&#xA;## Goals for 2025&#xA;&#xA;Moving into 2025, I want to write more code and of course articles and videos. Let‚Äôs get more specific of what I am thinking of:&#xA;&#xA;* Write blogs for FreeCodeCamp (at least 3)&#xA;    &#xA;* Learn Kubernetes in detail&#xA;    &#xA;* Write 25 articles on 100-days-of-Golang&#xA;    &#xA;* Learn Rust or Zig&#xA;    &#xA;* Get 2K subscribers on YouTube (100 videos)&#xA;    &#xA;## Conclusion&#xA;&#xA;It was a year to remember for sure. I said this last year as well but in a bad way. If there was a year to forget, it would have been late 2023 and the first half of 2024, but the second half of 2024 was a blessing for me. I overcame my fear of speaking to some extent, at least starting to address the issues. &#xA;&#xA;If I were to sum up the year, I am definitely happier than I was last year, and a lot more excited than I was last year. Money can&#39;t buy happiness, if you don&#39;t find joy within, nothing can be happiness. I think curiosity, consistency, and grit are pillars of my life and I stick to it this year and want to continue to do so.&#xA;&#xA;I will leave you with one more quote,&#xA;&#xA;&gt; &#34;Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it&#39;s about learning to dance in the rain.&#34; &#xA;&gt; -- Vivian Greene&#xA;&#xA;I hope your year was good too, if not may 2025 be the year of your dreams, you absolutely got this.&#xA;&#xA;See you on the other side üëã&#xA;&#xA;Happy New Year üéÜ&#xA;&#xA;And as always,&#xA;&#xA;Happy Coding :)&#xA;</content>

      <title>2023: Year Review</title>
      <link>meetgor.com/2023-review</link>
      <description>A developer retrospective of the year 2023. A reflection of the goals which I worked towards in tech as a developer.</description>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <content>&#xA;## Introduction&#xA;&#xA;2023, what a year! If you&#39;re a developer and haven&#39;t heard the word &#39;AI&#39; a million times, where have you been? With the introduction of Chat GPT in December 2022, the start of 2023 was buzzing with Open AI&#39;s flagship product. I also did a [2022 review](https://www.meetgor.com/2022-review/).&#xA;&#xA;The year 2023 was a pivotal year for me to gain experience in solving and delivering real-world problems to solutions. I went from a code-first approach to a code-last approach for solving a problem. The year was not ideal for freshers, as from the end of 2022 till 2023 there was a huge round of layoffs in big tech companies. The competition was too much for freshers and the AI hype added salt to the injury.&#xA;&#xA;I won&#39;t say that 2023 was a dark year, but a year that changed the trajectory of tech forever. I am grateful that I witnessed the introduction of AI in all domains, especially in tech. I think this year and the coming years will be exciting if you are a passionate developer, because I feel it is like an industrial revolution but in software development, there are LLMs, tools, and services that help developers boost their productivity and avoid laborious and boilerplate tasks.&#xA;&#xA;In 2023&#xA;&#xA;* Continued Solar Labs Internship (Backend)&#xA;    &#xA;* Contributed to Steampipe and MindsDB&#xA;    &#xA;* Joined Docsumo as a Python Intern&#xA;    &#xA;* Wrote 10 articles on Golang&#xA;    &#xA;* Finalist in Smart India Hackathon&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;Crossing Checklists of 2023 from 2022:&#xA;&#xA;* &lt;s&gt;Golang Deep Dive with Open Contributions and Projects&lt;/s&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;* &lt;s&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/s&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;* Kubernetes&#xA;    &#xA;* Rust&#xA;    &#xA;* Kafka&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;## Focus of 2023&#xA;&#xA;The year was mostly spent on internship tasks and writing go code for open-source projects. I have created over 6 SDKs in Golang for various APIs, Services, and Products. I had worked on APIs and specific tasks related to the products of the company I interned at.&#xA;&#xA;### The Solar Labs Internship&#xA;&#xA;Carrying forward where I left off in 2022, I interned from July 2022 to January 2023 at [The Solar Labs](https://arka360.com/) (now Arka 360) as a Backend Intern. The initial offer was for a 6-month remote internship. However, they were generous and offered an extension of 4 months i.e. till April 2023. So, I continued the internship as a backend intern from July 2022 till April 2023 i.e. 10 months. In this period I went from a novice developer to a somewhat organized and thoughtful developer.&#xA;&#xA;I learned a lot of things including:&#xA;&#xA;* Documenting APIs (keeping the structure clean and consistent)&#xA;    &#xA;* Collaborating with Peers for integration&#xA;    &#xA;* Deeply understanding of requirements and clarifying the scope&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;I was grateful to my mentors and seniors at this company for walking me through their experiences and guidance for the entire duration. Their patience with my silly doubts and mistakes gave me valuable feedback and helped me whenever I reached out. It was a pleasant experience working and learning with them.&#xA;&#xA;### Job Hunting&#xA;&#xA;I had taken a break of 20 days from coding, from April 27 to May 10th. This was a break when I traveled to Uttarakhand, did trekked at Kedarnath and Tungnath. It was a refreshing trip and one of the most memorable trips I will ever have with my family.&#xA;&#xA;Vacations were over and it was time to find other internships or jobs. I was in the shadows till now, as I had the internship from January to April. I didn&#39;t notice how bad the market was for getting a job, layoffs were happening right and left. But this is where I hit reality and was truly exposed to the tech market of 2023.&#xA;&#xA;#### 2022 vs 2023 Tech Job Market&#xA;&#xA;I got The Solar Labs Internship last year in 2022, I had just applied to 4-5 different openings, and in the 3rd application itself, I was invited to the interviews. Luckily I cleared the 2 rounds and got the internship.&#xA;&#xA;But this was 2023, the year that will be remembered as a drought of tech hiring. I started applying in June 2023, since I had semester exams in May. I applied to 5-10 openings, I knew it would be a bit hard since the layoffs were happening and the process might be a bit challenging. No response from those applied to another 10-15 openings, but no response, and it continued. Some responses were coming like I knew I had applied to a position where experience was required but I was a fresher so I was rejected.&#xA;&#xA;Weeks passed, months were passing, it was almost July end and on-campus placement started in college a ray of hope, but I didn&#39;t have much expectations from it. I was applying casually and getting a feel of the selection process. Something struck me in July and I remembered a company reaching out to me in October 2022, but I had to reject it since I was already in the internship, I however said I might look into next year. But things hit hard when I approached them in July 2023 requesting an opening of a junior developer, but the positions were closed.&#xA;&#xA;This is the point where everything starts to fall apart, I start losing my confidence and burning in the self-doubts. I was still applying to internships and jobs on campus as well as off-campus drives.&#xA;&#xA;#### Someone notices my skills&#xA;&#xA;Months passed, it was almost September 2023, and the ray of hope finally shone with a phone call for interview selection from Docsumo. Scheduled the interviews one after the other and took a week to complete the process, I was selected for a 2-month internship. I was not sure whether to be happy or sad, definitely it was a great startup but just for 2 months. It would feel as if I was just getting started, warm up, and got disconnected. But I took that offer to join from November to January.&#xA;&#xA;It was a heck of a ride to land an internship in 2023, I think I was lucky I got it here, it could have been worse.&#xA;&#xA;#### Job Market narrative&#xA;&#xA;I would like to emphasize the approach for getting a job/internship in 2024:&#xA;&#xA;* Be honest and clear about your goals and skills&#xA;    &#xA;* Learn the fundamentals of the thing you are looking to get hired for&#xA;    &#xA;* Learn in public&#xA;    &#xA;* Be proactive while telling your introduction&#xA;    &#xA;* Keep up with the latest trends and technologies&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;It would be over exaggeration no one can master all of them, but just be aware of what are you headed towards. It is a marathon, not a sprint, take it slowly and allow yourself to build a strong foundation, it will work in the long run.&#xA;&#xA;### Docsumo Internship&#xA;&#xA;I was not as excited about the Solar Labs internship as I was about the Docsumo one, as it was a hybrid. I felt a bit disconnected and not able to clearly express myself while working remotely sometimes. So, I felt Docsumo would be a good way to make myself comfortable speaking with seniors and collaborating.&#xA;&#xA;I joined in November, had a brief onboarding process, and was introduced nicely with the product itself. In the next week, I was given the task that I will be working over the few months of my stay at Docsumo. I have almost completed over a month at Docsumo and have had a great experience so far.&#xA;&#xA;It has changed my naive mindset while approaching a problem with a solution first and then code. It has helped me research a particular thing more deeply and use existing and well-tested solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.&#xA;&#xA;Still, there is a lot to learn and improve, will try my best to get good memories till I am here. Whatever happens, even for a short duration, they have given me hope. I am and will be grateful for the opportunity they have given me a driveling to work here,&#xA;&#xA;### Articles Written&#xA;&#xA;I mostly wrote about Golang and HTMX(Django) this year with a total of 14 posts:&#xA;&#xA;* [100 days of Go Series](https://www.meetgor.com/series/100-days-of-golang/)&#xA;    &#xA;* [HTMX + Django Chat Application](https://dev.to/mr_destructive/creting-a-chat-application-with-django-and-htmx-1095)&#xA;    &#xA;* Dev. to x Refine hackathon: [Utility Studio](https://dev.to/mr_destructive/utility-studio-quick-ai-powered-utilities-335j)&#xA;    &#xA;* Hashnode x Grafbase Hackathon: [Grafbase MindsDB](https://techstructiveblog.hashnode.dev/mindsdb-grafbase-graphql-api)&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;### Open Source Contributions&#xA;&#xA;While I was applying for jobs and internships, I was actively contributing to open-source projects like Steampipe and mindsdb. I had been contributing in bits and pieces to Turbot&#39;s steampipe CLI for over a year. I got introduced to MindsDB in mid-2023 and started contributing there as well.&#xA;&#xA;My primary languages for the contributions were Go and Python. I picked Golang last year and have been loving it since the beginning.&#xA;&#xA;I created over 6 Go SDKs for various APIs, Products, and Services like:&#xA;&#xA;* [Turso Go](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/turso-go)&#xA;    &#xA;* [PaLM2 API](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/palm)&#xA;    &#xA;* [Substack](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/substack-go)&#xA;    &#xA;* [MindsDB](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/mindsdb_go_sdk)&#xA;    &#xA;* [HuggingChat](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/hugging-chat-go)&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;Contributed to MindsDB Python SDK, Steampipe CLI, and LibSQL(Turso) shell, with the following sets of Pull requests:&#xA;&#xA;* [Turbot Steampipe CLI](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amr-destructive+) and [cohere ai plugin](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/steampipe-plugin-cohereai)&#xA;    &#xA;* [MindsDB Handlers](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amr-destructive+)&#xA;    &#xA;* [Turso CLI](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atursodatabase++mr-destructive&amp;type=pullrequests)&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;I loved working with these communities and look forward to contributing and learning more from these interactions. I am excited to check out flowpipe from Turbot, add a couple of plugins on the Steampipe hub, add a few handlers to mindsdb, and integrate Turso db with some golang and Python projects I have in mind.&#xA;&#xA;### Non Technical Things&#xA;&#xA;Apart from tech, there are other things as well I do in my free time like reading science fiction, and fantasy novels, writing short stories or novellas, travelling, and gaming. This year, I was able to balance many non-technical things as well like:&#xA;&#xA;* Read 7 books (all fiction) -&amp;gt; [Goodreads Profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/44008346)&#xA;    &#xA;* Started to write 2 novellas&#xA;    &#xA;* Trekked to the highest Shiva temple, [Tungnath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungnath)&#xA;    &#xA;* Maintained a daily journal throughout the year (at least 5 lines, digital)&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;## Goals for 2024&#xA;&#xA;The aim is still to be curious and actively adapt myself to learn new technologies with an open mindset. Some high-level goals for my tech journey moving into 2024 will look something like this:&#xA;&#xA;* Build a consistent blog writing routine&#xA;    &#xA;* Complete the 100-days-of-Golang Series&#xA;    &#xA;* Deep dive into Kubernetes and Micro-services&#xA;    &#xA;* Write a technical book&#xA;    &#xA;* Continue contributing to open source more actively in communities&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;I am focusing on writing technical blogs/documentation as it enhances my learning and increases my understanding on a deeper level. So, I will look forward to bringing back the number-crunching blog posts every week.&#xA;&#xA;Also, 2024 will be the year I will graduate from the university, so June 2024 is when I&#39;ll complete my final exams, and probably the convocation will happen in August. After that, I am a B.Tech I.T. graduate. Time went quickly!&#xA;&#xA;## Conclusion&#xA;&#xA;At the beginning of 2023, I was shy and under-confident, I didn&#39;t speak up clearly, and I made random side projects(I still do). But at the end of 2023, I had improved my communication skills and felt a lot more confident and expressive than I used to be. I still make random side projects but they are more refined and meaningful in what I want and achieve as a specific thing I want to make.&#xA;&#xA;2023 was a bitter sweat year in terms of expectations and results, but it had a significant impact on my growth as a stronger and better developer. Hopefully, 2024 will be a better and more challenging one. I always remember this quote when I feel challenged&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Smooth seas never made skilled sailors&#xA;&#xA;With 2023 finally wrapping up, It is time to clear up our bad memories and get excited for the rays of hope and new beginnings in 2024. I am heart-filled thank you for reading through this and I hope 2024 will be a great and happy year for you.&#xA;&#xA;Happy New Year and as always,&#xA;&#xA;Happy Coding :)&#xA;</content>

      <title>2022: Year Review</title>
      <link>meetgor.com/2022-review</link>
      <description>Dev Retro for 2022, the year that changed me from a shy to a confident developer. Grabbed opportunities for internships and made the most of them. Learned a ton of stuff.</description>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
      <content>&#xA;## Introduction&#xA;&#xA;Well, what a year! If 2021 was a start, 2022 was a year to convert a start into a goal. From collaborating on open-source projects to getting an internship, it was an exciting year! Created a couple dozen of projects(not finished as usual), wrote 40+ articles, did a couple of streams, learned the basics of golang, and spend 6 months as a backend dev intern at [Solarlabs](https://thesolarlabs.com/), just a year that was awaited for the hard work over the span of 2 years.&#xA;&#xA;This was a year, where I did things that were above my expectations, did an internship with college side by side for 6 months, started to stream on twitch(2 streams :),&#xA;&#xA;Some technical things I did and learnt in 2022:&#xA;&#xA;* Markata and blog revamp&#xA;    &#xA;* Learnt Docker&#xA;    &#xA;* Django Rest Framework Project and Django Basics completed 4 articles&#xA;    &#xA;* Podevcast(hashnode/netlify hackathon)&#xA;    &#xA;* Web App from scratch - django collaboration with mark gibney&#xA;    &#xA;* Daily.dev hackathon - bookmark CLI runner up&#xA;    &#xA;* 100 days of golang init 13 articles in April&#xA;    &#xA;* Django deployment (Heroku, railway, nixpacks) articles&#xA;    &#xA;* Switched from Windows 7 to Ubuntu&#xA;    &#xA;* Bought meetgor.com and started applying for an internship&#xA;    &#xA;* Ding 3 rounds of interviews got in at SolarLabs!&#xA;    &#xA;* Learned Flask, pytests, drf, in the process of internship assignments at other companies&#xA;    &#xA;* Switched to Lua config in Neovim with LSP&#xA;    &#xA;* Created lots of projects(vacation) dj-notes, aptui, rattlesnake, django mermaid&#xA;    &#xA;* HTMX with django, golang learning with Graphql, and REST API&#xA;    &#xA;* Picking up with neovim plugins for django, markrunner, black snipper&#xA;    &#xA;* deepgram and steampipe contribution at hacktoberfest&#xA;    &#xA;* Djankata, pykyll and some other contributions to golang&#xA;    &#xA;* Revamped APTUI with textual 2.0&#xA;    &#xA;* Devjournal with pykyll (bare bones ssg in python)&#xA;    &#xA;* All in all, golang and python deep dives this year with tons of projects and django huge learning experience at the internship.&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;## How did it start?&#xA;&#xA;The start was exciting and full of expectations due to a great start in 2021. I wrote around 80 articles starting almost halfway through the year. Also started to learn Django and shell scripting. With that knowledge, I created dozens of projects like web apps for silly games, portfolios, newsletters, and shell scripts for web scrapping and framework setups. I kept on with the pace and wrote articles and made projects.&#xA;&#xA;I got a collaboration on an awesome open-source project \[web-app-from-scratch\]([https://github.com/no-gravity/web\_app\_from\_scratch](https://github.com/no-gravity/web_app_from_scratch)) for a docker image for setting up Django from scratch. That was a great learning experience as I didn&#39;t know docker and in February 2022 was using Windows 7 back then, bad old days. I researched and got docker up and running on a cloud instance and learned the basics of docker.&#xA;&#xA;## Switch from Windows to Linux&#xA;&#xA;In May came a turning point for good, had to forcefully switch to Linux! I was under a ransomware attack due to the security vulnerability of windows 7 and had messed up all the files on the system. I had to completely wipe out the system and installed fresh ubuntu 22.04 on 14th May. Things changed and I was happy than ever to use my system. Thanks to that virus(xcvf ransomware virus) and natural instincts.&#xA;&#xA;I loved to code in the terminal, I have been using termux in lockdown which is a Linux-like terminal emulator for android. I learned the basics of bash and Linux commands with that and it was becoming my second nature to use Linux commands, so using windows was really frustrating. The incident happened at a good time and was able to switch from windows 7 to ubuntu.&#xA;&#xA;Setup Vim, tmux, and custom aliases was a great productive environment for me compared to windows. It changed the speed and mindset of my programming world.&#xA;&#xA;## Started learning golang&#xA;&#xA;I started to learn golang at the end of March and created a [100-day golang series](https://www.meetgor.com/series/100-days-of-golang/) on April 1st. It was not consecutive days you know, so it still looms around 25 days. It looks a lot less than I expected. Still, I feel really confident in writing golang, so much so that I decided to do the advent of code in golang this year.&#xA;&#xA;I completed around 13 articles in the month of April and then due to end-semester things getting in the way, was not able to keep a consecutive streak. Still, each week, I tried to write an article. And I have just 25 articles till now. It does not mean I did not learn golang, without writing any articles, I have a couple of projects on golang for creating bare-bones REST APIs and also a bit of GraphQL with DB connections. I haven&#39;t got a good amount of time to write detailed articles about them in a while, so maybe January is the time. I would like to complete 100 articles in the first quarter of 2023 that&#39;s the plan or at least the basics of web development with golang(backend of course).&#xA;&#xA;It was a fantastic learning experience by creating examples, and snippets and playing with some low-level stuff in the language.&#xA;&#xA;## Applied for internships&#xA;&#xA;At the end of May, that is when my exams were ending, I started to apply for internships targeting a backend(Django stack) for maybe 3-6 months. And it was a sad time in the first few weeks. I got a few offers talking but ended in rejection as I was not able to work full-time :( That hurts after doing some assignments and an interview.&#xA;&#xA;## TheSolarLabs Internship&#xA;&#xA;It all went on for 3 weeks, until the morning on 27 June, I read the application as &#34;Rejected&#34; to [SolarLabs](https://thesolarlabs.com/). Anyone would have lost hope there, and so did I. And to anyone&#39;s surprise or credit for their blunder, I got a call from them for scheduling an interview! I am not making this up, the portal still says &#34;rejected&#34; and in the chats, it asks for a resume! Some nervous times.&#xA;&#xA;After 3 days of interviews, I finally got the offer letter of confirmation. For 6 months and a good bit of stipend. It was my preferred Django stack, with some unknown grounds of the Django rest framework. I realized rather quickly in the first interview itself, I need to get some DRF stuff up! There was a lot of stuff to learn that I didn&#39;t know existed, I was baffled by how great was DRF then. That&#39;s the first bit of learning from the interview itself, it showed, how much there is to learn.&#xA;&#xA;Soon after the onboarding process and getting a bit familiar with the designing product, I was presented with the code repository and time to get familiarity and set up the system (python3.7, postman, editor, etc). There came the first task soon in the following week. it looked doable and indeed just a matter of time to get familiarity with the problem statement. it was a task for fetching some data from weather API and store in a specific format.&#xA;&#xA;As the days passed, I was introduced to the tech scrum, like a daily update for the tas done yesterday and todo today. It was really new to me, I have never heard of such systems but realized it might be a development process. Soon college started and it was a mess thereafter. had to balance college attendance and attend scrum with clashing times sometimes. But to date got off with the semesters.&#xA;&#xA;### Key takeaways from the internship&#xA;&#xA;I don&#39;t want to get into all the details of the internship tasks but here&#39;s a summary of what I learned in a gist.&#xA;&#xA;* Django Rest Framework viewsets, routers, and actions&#xA;    &#xA;* Django Signals, Admin section, API designs in a better way&#xA;    &#xA;* Azure (some specific things like function deployment, config, sas tokens, pipelines, python SDK, etc.)&#xA;    &#xA;* SQL ( got some good practice on joins and nested queries)&#xA;    &#xA;* ERP technology(erpnext and python setup)&#xA;    &#xA;* JWT tokens set up in Django&#xA;    &#xA;* Process for designing API from scratch for a given feature&#xA;    &#xA;* Cashfree and Stripe integration in Django&#xA;    &#xA;* Dockerfile and buildkit specific features&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;## Learning Constantly&#xA;&#xA;Currently in a hope of continuing the internship as I have thoroughly enjoyed working here and it has been a great learning experience. But one thing was really important this year again, to not stop learning and building. Don&#39;t mind if the idea is small or useless, just building the project and overcoming the entry barrier for learning the technology has been the quote for everything in my developer journey.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; When your mind feels lost, letting it free and driving new places strikes a inspriation for another take off, don&#39;t run, enjoy the walk, it&#39;s a marathon not a sprint.&#xA;&#xA;Building projects which are useless or not making sense to anybody might be a different thing but what it means to yourself matters the most. There might be instances where you might be failing, not having any ideas, burnout, imposter syndrome, and some other fuzzy words in tech. These situations are meant to improve you in one or the other way, If you run out of ideas, just take a break, look at your personal state and hobbies besides programming and get some inspiration from other fields and apply them in the programming world were some lessons I learned in some rough times during the year.&#xA;&#xA;There will be or rather should be times when you feel down or lose inspiration, these times drive the minds in different directions as programming can be a bit draining and one can quickly lose motivation if there are no results straight away.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Hard work takes time to turn into results, patience and actions are the key.&#xA;&#xA;I had a hobby for writing, I had written a novel(maybe not a novel it&#39;s not that big) when I was in 8th grade, and had a ton of ideas for stories but was stuck with the hypothetical thing called the perfection of time, plot, and ideas. I watched a youtube video about writing and it just fascinated me to write again, and it began. I started to write my novel which is handwritten into an ebook. I was consistent for a few days but things got wild and were moved away from it. The new year will be the perfect free time to go for it and at least have one fiction novel to my name.&#xA;&#xA;I am also reading fantasy novels, I have read Elantris and am in mid of reading Mistborn. I have been enjoying reading and writing as a programmer, but want to get into fantasy as well. It is so exciting and fascinating as a human to fly with creativity. I am grateful to have eyes and a healthy mind to read and see the beauty of the world.&#xA;&#xA;## Hits and Misses in 2022&#xA;&#xA;There were a few pullbacks in 2022 for me, if there are good times, one must be prepared for bad ones it seemed. The worst thing about bad times is that you sometimes don&#39;t realize that you are in one. I had almost the same count of articles compared to the previous year comparing a whole year to half the year(I started blogging in June 2022).&#xA;&#xA;* Unable to write out words&#xA;    &#xA;* Feeling exhausted and anxious sometimes&#xA;    &#xA;* Not able to communicate properly with mentors&#xA;    &#xA;* Sometimes, college and working on internship tasks clash badly&#xA;    &#xA;* addicted to solving a problem and can&#39;t focus on other things(maybe a good thing sometimes)&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;## Tech list for 2023&#xA;&#xA;* Golang deep dive with projects and open-source contributions&#xA;    &#xA;* Machine Learning (Tensorflow python and Keras)&#xA;    &#xA;* Kafka&#xA;    &#xA;* Kubernetes and Microservices&#xA;    &#xA;* AoC with Rust&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;So, these are some of the technologies I will try to learn in 2023. I have a basic knowledge of golang, but I will like to get into the specific things golang is used for like concurrency and channels. I have been wanting to learn machine learning with projects, and this year I am serious about it, I have a couple of ideas for web apps with ML, and will try to get it up and rolling.&#xA;&#xA;Some specific technologies I want to learn to include Kafka for data pipelines and streams. Some deployment tools like Kubernetes but before that, I will be learning a bit more about docker networking.&#xA;&#xA;This year I did AoC with golang, to complete all 25 days, but did around 12 days. Still will be trying to solve this over the month. Next year, I will be trying AoC in Rust. I love low-level programming languages, go is great but rust is extreme.&#xA;&#xA;## Conclusion&#xA;&#xA;So, that&#39;s a wrap for 2022. A great year for learning a lot of stuff. Hopefully, the next year will be a better one. More collaboration and more opportunities. I am grateful to so many people who came into my life and have played important roles for me to develop into a backend developer and even a human. My mentors and colleagues, real-life and Twitter friends, and GitHub collaborators. I would have not reached here if I would have not met any one of them. Thank you. May you too have a great year and life ahead full of opportunities and success.&#xA;&#xA;Happy New Year, Happy Coding :)&#xA;</content>
