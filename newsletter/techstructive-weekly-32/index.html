<p>At this juncture, I might not think, but I should have context on what to do. Figuring out the actual problem from the fuss, and then boiling that down to simple technical problems is something I need to work on. I realized this a lot over the past couple of weeks.</p>
<p>LLMs can think provided the human had did a bit of thinking at first. It is just going to predict the next word or code, based on what is already there in the internet, however some things are created of pure intuition and wisdom that is the one that will set someone apart from others.</p>

<li><a href="https://toddle.dev/blog/why-is-everyone-trying-to-replace-software-engineers">Why is everyone trying to replace software engineers</a>: I had my first meeting where there were clients, actual users of the product. And I was a technical guy so not much needed for me to talk just demo the things, went a bit technical and in a jiffy but thats it, I think we will be replaced with the people who can understand the business better and not by any LLM. True.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.yossarian.net/2025/01/10/Be-aware-of-the-Makefile-effect">Beware of the Makefile Effect</a>: Adding already solved problem to your code is not bad, but randomly yanking and making a saphagetti of the codes surely is a problem. But the counter point to that would be, how to know if the thing we are copying is actually good, that sense need to be developed and I think that comes with time and experience and mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="watched">Watched</h2>
<p>Really didn’t had much time to watch anything. On saturday and sunday though I watched the How to use LLMs by Andrej Karapathy. I mentioned this last week as well but this week I watched it completely.</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT Interpreter</li>
<li>Grok AI unhinged mode</li>
<li>Custom GPTs</li>
<li>Internet Search Tool</li>
</ul>
<p>This was really insightful, I tried a lot of things, and one thing or the other really helped me solve so many intricate bugs and discrepancies.</p>

<ul>
<li>We can use ChatGPT to debug the code, just provide the source file and could run and understand what to do and figure out issues</li>
<li>Also the interpreter mode can be used to provide a data source file and allow it to compute a few things to cross-validate with our code, this really saved me hours of debugging and quickly point out the issues, here is one conversation where the numbers were slightly off from my code and it helped me figure out that that was actually an issue in the data source and not in my code.<br>

<li>Providing a larger system prompt is powerful and we could cramp a lot of boilerplate data or any data source that instead goes into user prompt to save tokens. This is really powerful if we are making one shot calls, and not a chat like conversation systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>Just a thought that might give you some insights and can make you think about somethings in a different way.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is just my thought, I think I could write a article on it.<br>
Next week I have 3 articles in mind</p>
<ul>
<li>Use positive conditions</li>
<li>Python is tactile and golang is mechanical</li>
<li>Prompt is the new code, worry about the art of prompt rather than code</li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-ocr">Mistral OCR</a>: This LLM things are taking over everythign slowly, every domain of things will now have LLM-equivalent, what do we call it? LLMfying, LLMing, GPTing, AIng, LLMify, ok enough jokes, but this is seriously good.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/07/x-now-lets-you-query-grok-by-mentioning-it-in-replies/">X let’s you query grok by mentioning it in reply</a>: That is wild, I just got access to GrokAI App on my phone and its blazingly fast. Really that LLM is different from others, not much but a little open.</li>
