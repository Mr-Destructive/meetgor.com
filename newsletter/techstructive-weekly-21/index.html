This was the do and don’t multiply expression problem. It was a good problem, and I solved it with a different approach of using enabled and disabled portions of strings to strip off the disabled strings and then use the part one logic for the actual answer.Double click to interact with video</li>

It was a nice article, I agree that a few blogs are lying between markdown and rich content. I also love to express ideas that markdown might limit.</li>

I don’t think this is a big release, yes there are a few cool little things that are added up in the standard library. But nothing groundbreaking as the 1.23 and 1.21 releases.</li>

This is to the point, I would like to write the code that matters and leave the rest to LLM to generate because it’s not worth the time for me to write everything. I still want to write the stuff that might be oblivious because I have not written it yet in my life, I would like to fail and still try again.<a href="https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/p/surely-not-all-codes-worth-it?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_campaign=post_embed&amp;utm_medium=web"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-2HZ!,w_56,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff114450f-2313-48c6-a253-a1d476c21d93_1164x1164.png" alt="">Register SpillSurely not all code's worth itListen to this: “I don’t use AI for programming, because I want to learn and get better at programming and if I have an LLM generate code for me, I’m not learning anything…Read more7 months ago · 29 likes · 10 comments · Thorsten Ball</a></li>

<p>This is relatable, I can’t actually comment here, I am a junior but yes working with a AI chatbot/assistant is frustrating as hell sometimes, sometimes it is refreshing. I believe it will be a skill to work with LLMs in few years. I admire Simon Wilson for this, he just tries wild things to make it work for him.</p>

<p>This was a heart-touching review, I can relate to it, you will have everything before there will be nothing. This is the cycle, life is a miss and a bliss. There will be times you jump ahead in the day, but there will be times when you will struggle to wake up, even fear to live, but it is the one who goes through it and still does it anyway.</p>

This was a surprising read, I can’t believe that it is possible to live life without having a consistent stream of income. I just feel it is not for me and my lifestyle, I can’t live like that.</li>

<p>This is good only for some specific tasks, it could be useful for scrapping and getting certain things for the day. It has 24 hours of turnaround time, which means it could return anywhere between 1 second to 24 hours, it will respond late obliviously, essentially it will wait for less peak hours and traffic time to respond to the request.</p>
