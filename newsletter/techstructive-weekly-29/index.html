<p>This hits well. With AI in town, AI will require you to learn the art of debugging, unlearn things like copy-pasting from the Internet, and change your perception of code and technology.</p>
<p>It will be less about learning, and more about re-learning or removing the perceptions about the already existing things while writing code.
