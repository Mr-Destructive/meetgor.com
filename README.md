- And Programming/Development in general

This is a personal blog made with html/css/markdown, generated using Burrow(a SSG written in Golang) and hosted on GitHub pages.
- GitHub Pages for hosting
- Turso Database for storing/syncing posts
- Netlify Cloud Functions for serverless functions (adding and syncing posts, triggering builds)

### Techstructive Blog is created with a aim to learn programming and have fun in the process.
