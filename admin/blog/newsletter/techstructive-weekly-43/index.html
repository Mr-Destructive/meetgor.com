If not, I am going to create one specifically for LLM and AI stuff, because this thing is getting out of hand. We are seeing models drop almost every 2 days. This is crazy stuff. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, xAI, Alibaba, Cohere, in loops over months and weeks with new models. The never-ending cycle. Let’s see if we can predict what model will be next.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Ok, this week we say 5 LLM models are getting released, and those are not any normal models, those are quite a significant push in the state of the art for what LLMs can do.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/www.anthropic.com\/news\/claude-4\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Anthropic with Claude 4 family (Sonnet and Opus)\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Quite solid in coding task, I just tried giving it a golang file and it corrected all the errors and weird quirks it had.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/mistral.ai\/news\/devstral\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Mistral with Devstral\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;This is a 14 GB, 23 Billion Parameter model for coding task\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Not sure about performance but it requires 32 GB Ram to run, so I am out of uck on that.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Waiting for a slight lightweight model.

<p>What a whirlwind of a week. This was expected, nothing new. New week, new models, every day feels closer to losing the developer job. But everytime, AI sucks and human grug brain works.</p>
<p>This week, I took a step back and tried to ease myself out from this AI slop. Want to really plan the things out and start the grind again. Need to re-align my core values and get back to the consistent and curious flaming torch in guiding myself in the AI abyss.</p>

<p>LLMs and AI Labs are out of control, they are releasing new models left and right.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-llm-models-released-this-week-5">Number of LLM models released this week: 5</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gemini 2.5 Flash Pro (improved)</li>
<li>Gemma 3n</li>
<li>Devstral</li>
<li>Vercel’s v0-1.0-md model</li>
<li>Claude 4 family (Sonnet and Opus)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a new section. At this rate, I am overwhelmed trying to keep track of which model is released at what time, since new models keep popping up constantly.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time reading and understanding about Agents, and will be creating some form of content around it. For my understanding, as well as creating a resource for this AI hype, to get my hands dirty.</p>
<p>Some personal news, I migrated my blog from markata to my own SSG from scratch, named Burrow. Bold move! I don’t care, no one’s reading my post, so it doesn’t matter, I kept the links intact. A win for me.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/burrow">Burrow</a>
<ul>
<li>Built from bare-bones golang</li>
<li>Only 3rd party library (goldmark) used for markdown parsing (thought of wiring own markdown parser some day to remove this :)</li>
<li>Github SDK for some automation and LibSQL driver for database syncing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/WaylonWalker/markata">Markata</a> by Waylon Walker
<ul>
<li>Nothing wrong with this SSG, it was fantastic to write our own plugins, and most of the plugins were built-in. But I wanted to explore more about Golang. And this was the move I took.</li>
<li>The current burrow-ssg in golang is inspired by markata</li>

<h3 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the week</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Stay hungry, stay foolish.&quot;<br>
— <em>Steve Jobs</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I listened to the speech of Steve Jobs, and there were three lessons that he tried to convey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow your heart, let the dot connects</li>
<li>Keep looking, don’t settle</li>
<li>Do it as if you are living the last day of your life</li>
</ul>
<p>This just are valuable life lessons that he might have spend 50 years on. These are given by wisdom and not knowledge.</p>
<p>Stay hungry, bring the curiosity, and keep fighting and keep throwing your hands and legs at it, you will be at the top one day.</p>

<li>This is silly; the more detail you put, the more detailed your tests have to be</li>
<li>The more tests there are, the probability of all of them passing would start decreasing, and hence, it could cause subtle bugs</li>
<li>So I think it is a matter of convincing yourself to write more tests and documentation</li>

<ul>
<li>This is a good take, if someone has put an open-to-work badge, it might mean that the person is giving indication to his/her openness to work.</li>
<li>We can’t judge by that, and should not, as the person might be in a weird situation and can’t openly express their situation so the badge gives them a slight help in communicating without actually speaking about it.</li>

<li>On one side, I am happy that I am a junior, I am dabbling with AI agents and tab tab things, but it’s kind of weird to use them.</li>

<p>Do we have a website to track which thing, product, model, or tool was released when? If not, I am going to create one specifically for LLM and AI stuff, because this thing is getting out of hand. We are seeing models drop almost every 2 days. This is crazy stuff. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, xAI, Alibaba, Cohere, in loops over months and weeks with new models. The never-ending cycle. Let’s see if we can predict what model will be next.</p>
<p>Ok, this week we say 5 LLM models are getting released, and those are not any normal models, those are quite a significant push in the state of the art for what LLMs can do.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4">Anthropic with Claude 4 family (Sonnet and Opus)</a>
<ul>
<li>Quite solid in coding task, I just tried giving it a golang file and it corrected all the errors and weird quirks it had.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/devstral">Mistral with Devstral</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a 14 GB, 23 Billion Parameter model for coding task</li>
<li>Not sure about performance but it requires 32 GB Ram to run, so I am out of uck on that.</li>
<li>Waiting for a slight lightweight model. Qwen is a great model in that sense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/google-gemini-updates-io-2025/">Google with the improved Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro</a>
<ul>
<li>This was short lived as Claude 4 dropped with all guns blazing</li>
<li>But Gemini is now getting into everything at Google</li>
<li>This is leaning on the magnetic route in every product</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/docs/v0/api">Vercel with V0-1.0-md model</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a bold move from Vercel, could be used by UI developers extensively</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tools</p>
<ul>
<li>Google with <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/jules/">Jules</a> and <a href="https://stitch.withgoogle.com/">Stitch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-flow-veo-ai-filmmaking-tool/">Google’s Flow with Veo 3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, too much Google</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-io-2025-all-our-announcements/">100 things that Google released at the IO 2025</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Phew! That is a lot of news in a week. Google and Anthropic have nailed it. Google is going all over the place with a commanding position, Anthropic taking the focus to the developer ecosystem by making the model better and better at tool calling and coding tasks.</p>

<li>Which model do you think is the ground-breaking model?</li>
<li>What agentic tools/IDE do you find more useful and help in improving productivity?</li>

<p>That’s it from this 43rd edition of my weekly learning. I hope you enjoyed it, and leave comments on what you think about some of my takes or any feedback.</p>
