Not ideal as you don\u0026#39;t know if that would be ideal way to get data in all cases, example artist and album, you write for each artist, find albums, but what if the number of albums by each artist keep growing and more people ar accessing different artists data together, so not sure how to get data for any query. In SQL however, we dont say how to get data, we say what and from where to get data\n- Relational Model\n- Structure\n- Integrity (constraints)\n- Manipulation\n- Its upon the database system how to query\/mutate the data\n- Components\n- Database storage(bits)\n- Physical storage (pages, files, etc)\n- Logical Schema (schema, constraints)\n- External Schema (common table data)\n- Application\n- Everything below application is a db system\n- Relation is a set, relation of attributes that represent entities\n- Tuple is a set of attribute values in relation. Primary key, uniquely identify a tuple in a relation. Foreign key, related tuples(attributes) across relations. Constraints, conditions must hold for any tuple in a relation.\n- Relational Algebra\n- Select (where conditions)\n- projection (select with what to extract optional modify the selected values)\n- union (all, must have same number of attributes)\n- intersection (same but common)\n- difference (same but difference)\n- product (cartesian product, cross join)\n- join (natural, without params, common ones, same attribute name, can use params like using \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;on\u0026lt;\/strong\u0026gt;)\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https:\/\/youtu.be\/mN--sGH97dY\u0026#34;\u0026gt;SVGs are so cool\u0026lt;\/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;I really didn’t knew SVGs can be that cool, you can scale, animate and even make interactive elements.\u0026lt;\/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;I need to add some SVGs on my blog.

<p>What a week, almost broke prod for half an hour! On Monday, can you believe it? I didn’t but that was a bug. Patched it and moved on. Had a consistent posting and learning sessions daily for an hour about SQL and SQLite. Feels good.</p>
<p>Had an situation where knowing javascript was a big deal and I don’t feel like writing javascript, it just doesn’t appeal to me, I guess I have to amp that up. Anyways, one more reason added for hating javascript, its unavoidable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only painful thing about Javascript, its unavoidable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, back to SQL, I am absolutely feeling energetic to talk and learn about SQLite daily. I think we’ll be 100 posts in no time. I am thinking about creating and completing a project this weekend. Let’s see if we are able to do it.</p>
<h3 id="quote-of-the-week">Quote of the week</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To live is to wrestle with despair, yet never allow despair to have the last word</p>
<p>— <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19982-the-country-is-in-deep-trouble-we-ve-forgotten-that-a">Cornel West</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all have problems, but we can’t let it define us, rather we will be defined on how we reacted to them. You can give up, but either you’ll be unsatisfied or below average. You have to go through the pain in order to bear the fruit, and even if the fruit doesn’t wag your way, so be it, if you enjoyed doing it (writing or reading in my case) then I believe that was worth it. Else what is the purpose of life? Who are we really and why do we even breathe. Just enjoy the thing you enjoy there is should be no measure for productivity when it comes to living.</p>

<li>This blog advocates to meditate 10 minutes a day, it helps maybe. I need to try. But that comes after doing something, you act first, then if the result is not coming, you get anxious and frustrated if it failed, in that case, you need to calm down, you did whatever you could, but now you need to wait for it to resolve or learn from the failures.</li>
<li>Getting anxiety from the current problems is true, I cannot keep my mind away. I need to breathe and let it go, will try over the weekend and continue if it makes me happier.</li>

<li><a href="http://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/sql-needed-structure/">SQL Needed structure</a>
<ul>
<li>This is a bad take, What is more structured than SQL? If you are trying to get heirarchial data in SQL, you will be comprising redundancy. Like literally for the ease of the access, you will duplicate json blobs everywhere. I work in that environment and know the pains of those queries. I won’t recommend MongoDB ever to anyone. Just use structured data, it would be a one time investment on schema design, but it sustains and is much easier and predictable.</li>
<li>It could have been other things like sharding, I would have agreed, but this nope.</li>

<ul>
<li>A really cool observation. Anyone can pick a commit hash and simply run a command to obtain the static files. Or better just checkout to the output branch and go back to the date. Its like a time machine.</li>
<li>I love static site generators.</li>

<li>Feel it, Just completing tasks, merging PRs, lists of metrics improved won’t help, if you don’t feel it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Prepared a detailed notes as I was watching</li>
<li>data model - how to define the relation, rules</li>
<li>schema - defining the specifics of the data model, details
- relational (the primary kind, we only think of this as real dbs) key value - graph - document - column - array - and more
- Initial idea: Writing cobol in 1970s to get data, literally telling the db to how to get the data. Not ideal as you don't know if that would be ideal way to get data in all cases, example artist and album, you write for each artist, find albums, but what if the number of albums by each artist keep growing and more people ar accessing different artists data together, so not sure how to get data for any query. In SQL however, we dont say how to get data, we say what and from where to get data
- Relational Model
- Structure
- Integrity (constraints)
- Manipulation
- Its upon the database system how to query/mutate the data
- Components
- Database storage(bits)
- Physical storage (pages, files, etc)
- Logical Schema (schema, constraints)
- External Schema (common table data)
- Application
- Everything below application is a db system
- Relation is a set, relation of attributes that represent entities
- Tuple is a set of attribute values in relation. Primary key, uniquely identify a tuple in a relation. Foreign key, related tuples(attributes) across relations. Constraints, conditions must hold for any tuple in a relation.
- Relational Algebra
- Select (where conditions)
- projection (select with what to extract optional modify the selected values)
- union (all, must have same number of attributes)
- intersection (same but common)
- difference (same but difference)
- product (cartesian product, cross join)
- join (natural, without params, common ones, same attribute name, can use params like using <strong>on</strong>)</li>

<li>I really didn’t knew SVGs can be that cool, you can scale, animate and even make interactive elements.</li>
<li>I need to add some SVGs on my blog. This is absolutely inspired me.</li>

<li>I know and care about the code</li>
<li>I know the code but don’t care enough</li>
<li>I don’t know what I am doing</li>
<li>Developers, let’s focus on the first 2 and we should be fine, the 3rd one is a luxury as a hobby.</li>

<li>I don’t know what that means, but is a big thing according to the big tech bros.</li>

<p>Nothing happening for a few weeks now, finally there is a slow down in the models and all this hype. I want this hype to be minimum as possible for a stretched duration of time, as it helps learn and do things peacefully.</p>
