Getting a blog post featured at hackernews, hmm, I always wonder how a post gets featured at hackernews, does the author submit it to the site, or the community post it there? Really curious about the working of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://xuanwo.io/links/2025/02/personal-software-is-becoming-a-trend/">Personal Software is becoming a trend</a><br>
Wasn’t this the hobby of software developers from the beginning, we try to solve problems and eventually land up a project a software for our own nerdy needs.</li>

This model looks worse, no comments. Haven’t tried yet, but this commentary gave a good gist about what to expect.</li>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/rAEqP9VEhe8?si=exMiTiElXTPv4TjV">Indirect Prompt injection in LLMs - Numberphile</a><br>
This is really interesting, I mean corrupting the data source is so easy, write a few blog posts, publish on the internet and source it in your RAG and let hallucination be in the peek. What a problem to have, more advancements, more harder problems to solve. Man! becoming a security person is valuable then ever.Double click to interact with video</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/1bxNuY_a1xo">Legion AI Agent Framework</a><br>
This frameworks looks so like other frameworks, not sure why make one so much fuss about. I mean I get it, for learning purposes it is so cool, even I would like to try making one, but committing to it as a publicly available project as a real project and not a silly side project, seems a engagement bait or something. Just do it man.Double click to interact with video</li>

<h2 id="learnt">Learnt</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use positive conditions (or names or end variable names) instead of negative conditions
<ul>
<li>For example if you have to control the case of a string, i.e. upper of lower case, use the parameter case_sensitive=True instead of ignore_case=True. The word ignore impacts the thinking and messes up the logic inside of head and lead to mistakes while writing, however more on the reading code.</li>
<li>This lesson I have read a few places and now I see why it is important. I will write a short rambling advice post on my blog soon this weekend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continue as you like it is the word for LLMs to continue after you added a prompt that gets rejected by the LLM</li>
<li>Writing python is like tactile keyboard and writing golang is mechanical keyboard. Food for thought for next week, one more blog post to be written.</li>
<li>Pivot table in google sheets. A real handy way to sort out and do data analysis from other sheets, or I should say master data.</li>
