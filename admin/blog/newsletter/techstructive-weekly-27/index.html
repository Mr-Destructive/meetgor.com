I had been doing a lot of things in the past few weeks, so this week I decided to take things a little slowly. If I just keep on being that productive, it would be a burnout soon.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, I created a new kind of video using a presentation-style approach, wrote a bit of python, and debugged it a ton, and now I see why tests are handy. I don’t have to debug the issue every time I make a change here, If run tests, I know exactly which test failed and where to look out for so easily.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I started an initiative to write something for an hour, I did just once a day, the other day’s life took over me.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h3 id=\u0026#34;quote-of-the-week\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Quote of the week\u0026lt;\/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026amp;quot;Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.\u0026amp;quot;\u0026lt;\/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;– Anne Lamott\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;\/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Yes, I just took this week slowly.

A network where the LLM will branch out to a specific network where it can use the weights more efficiently instead of the entire weights.

I had a issue to solve, or rather refactor a logic a little, but testing those changes was getting too tiring. I saw this and one thing stuck to me, is about tests.

<p>It was a bit of lazy day, not that lazy though, did a lot of things while being lazy. I had been doing a lot of things in the past few weeks, so this week I decided to take things a little slowly. If I just keep on being that productive, it would be a burnout soon.</p>
<p>So, I created a new kind of video using a presentation-style approach, wrote a bit of python, and debugged it a ton, and now I see why tests are handy. I don’t have to debug the issue every time I make a change here, If run tests, I know exactly which test failed and where to look out for so easily.</p>
<p>I started an initiative to write something for an hour, I did just once a day, the other day’s life took over me.</p>

<p>Yes, I just took this week slowly. I took deep gazes and deep writing, want to have silent walks next week. Recharging the creative batteries before they go out. It is important to charge up and slow down simultaneously in my opinion, rather than waiting for yourself to drain away.</p>

This was a great video explaining the key difference on how Deepseek did the LLM game differently, a concept called MoE mixture of experts. A network where the LLM will branch out to a specific network where it can use the weights more efficiently instead of the entire weights. Nice thinking, this feels so high-level view, how exciting or frustrating it would be to do that in a low-level and actually hands-on with the actual model.Double click to interact with video</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/lurbDAEU0KM?si=31-08t72M-DmbBM2">Martin Fowler on Refactoring Podcast</a><br>
Golden hour, this just changed my perspective on tests and that too at the right time. I had a issue to solve, or rather refactor a logic a little, but testing those changes was getting too tiring. I saw this and one thing stuck to me, is about tests. Testing would be the perfect thing to avoid debugging, it will not solve bugs, but it will avoid their creation in the first place. Valuable advice about everything, every minute or second of this video is pure gold.Double click to interact with video</li>
