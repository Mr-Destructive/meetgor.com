Whatever the truth is, we are going to get replaced, that\u0026#39;s not true. We as humans can\u0026#39;t be replaced, our thinking and our mindset, however, will be, needs to be. Ignorance and Ego need to be kept aside, Curiosity should be the driver of your mind.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2 id=\u0026#34;manifestation-over-generation\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Manifestation over Generation\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;See, AI can\u0026#39;t replace humans, that is sure, it just can\u0026#39;t. You see, it is generating things, not manifesting.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Humans don\u0026#39;t generate stuff, they manifest, robots generate stuff, and the thing that comes out of a human\u0026#39;s work is blended with emotions, that is manifestation. Generation is not the same as manifestation. Emotion can\u0026#39;t be generated by robots, it is not possible, and even if possible at some time, it will be an artificial emotion, not a manifested emotion.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Humans create art, they can photograph, they can draw, they can illustrate, they can think, they can feel. Robots don\u0026#39;t. Image generation is not an art, it is science, writing text is not art, it\u0026#39;s labor, creating projects is not art, it\u0026#39;s again labor.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This AI thing is so new that we are too behind in the mindset to think about what they actually do. Believe this truth that they generate stuff (technically predict stuff) based on the things they already know of from the internet or existing data.

Right now there is a step increase in the knowledge that we think we are receiving because of AI, but that is due to this thing being new, once everyone has experienced (vibed), and seen the generation, it feels like it’s generating the same thing in different ways, there is no discovery, there is no new thing in what it does. Imagine a world where we’re all just remixing the same old ideas, with no fresh spark.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I am not bashing AI here, true it can do a lot of things, but it can actually do better than some humans, sure. But AI should do the chores so that you can do the art, and not the other way around.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;embed-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;blockquote class=\u0026#34;twitter-tweet\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34; dir=\u0026#34;ltr\u0026#34;\u0026gt;You know what the biggest problem with pushing all-things-AI is?

For programming yes, for art, yes, for everything maybe, maybe not. It really depends on what are we trying to get from it. Sometimes, it is like a 5-year-old kid, blabbing as if it doesn\u0026#39;t understand the basics, other times, it is like an 80-year-old, pouring some tidbits of wisdom (artificial) in some ways.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2 id=\u0026#34;use-ai-as-a-copilot-not-a-pilot\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Use AI as a copilot not a pilot\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Use AI as you are the senior and instruct it to do things in your favor, not let it take control and you follow like an idiot.  Don’t follow it blindly; steer it. Do not forget to think, a bit, do not remove the human element from the generation, convert that generation to your manifestation.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That is the point I\u0026#39;m trying to make, you need to focus on your craft, your inner conflict, and your inner curiosity that drives you to read this exact post, AI can\u0026#39;t do that for you, it never will. There will always be a need to learn, to decide, to act, to manifest, to feel. This will lead to more data, and this will keep the AI up-to-date on what humans know collectively. Actually, AIs are no smarter than collective human intelligence, it is just not possible, because whatever it is trained on is human data that humans know, have observed, have felt, and have manifested, it can hallucinate that it might be like this, who is there to confirm it?\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2 id=\u0026#34;humans\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Humans\u0026lt;\/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Humans are not doomed, it is AI that will be if humans stop doing their actions. Stop worrying, start enjoying, start manifesting, start exploring, just start doing things. If we rely too much on AI generation, it would be a disaster that you don\u0026#39;t want to be in, a fogged mind, rusted by its inability to think, to feel, to act. We’ve got to keep manifesting, writing songs, snapping photos, dreaming up what’s next. That’s how we stay ahead, how we keep humanity humming.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You got this!\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Your buddy,\nMeet\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thanks for reading,\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This looks like a ramble, but please don\u0026#39;t judge me, I am just a junior software developer trying to navigate life, and based on what I observe and know, it feels this way.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n"

It means you’re not glued to your phone, and that’s a win. But for those who’ve felt the hype or the creep, it’s hard to ignore. People are shouting about an AI revolution, some with awe, others with warnings. It’s changing things fast, and I want to share what I see as a junior software developer living in this wild moment.

<h2 id="ai-is-reaching-everywhere">AI is reaching everywhere</h2>
<p>Beyond the hype, there are the things that will drive the humanity. Yes, the hype is actually a revolution, an AI revolution we are blessed or (maybe cursed, time will tell) to witness the birth of AI-related chatbots and tools that can do the tasks for us.</p>
<p>AI is reshaping our world, not just our tech. AI or LLMs whatever you can call it, generates stuff, spits out text, pictures, code, and maybe even decisions (Agentic is the name here). This is generated or actually predicted by AI based on what humans have fed it, the human-generated data.</p>

<p>And that human-generated data, I am calling it manifestation, which is the combination of effort with emotion.</p>

<p>Now here comes the actual argument, it is inevitable people say, AI will replace humans, or another argument is people will be replaced by people using AI effectively. Whatever the truth is, we are going to get replaced, that's not true. We as humans can't be replaced, our thinking and our mindset, however, will be, needs to be.

<p>See, AI can't replace humans, that is sure, it just can't. You see, it is generating things, not manifesting.</p>
<p>Humans don't generate stuff, they manifest, robots generate stuff, and the thing that comes out of a human's work is blended with emotions, that is manifestation. Generation is not the same as manifestation.

Right now there is a step increase in the knowledge that we think we are receiving because of AI, but that is due to this thing being new, once everyone has experienced (vibed), and seen the generation, it feels like it’s generating the same thing in different ways, there is no discovery, there is no new thing in what it does. Imagine a world where we’re all just remixing the same old ideas, with no fresh spark.</p>
<p>I am not bashing AI here, true it can do a lot of things, but it can actually do better than some humans, sure. But AI should do the chores so that you can do the art, and not the other way around.</p>

<p>AI is a good assistant, yes 100% in some cases. For programming yes, for art, yes, for everything maybe, maybe not. It really depends on what are we trying to get from it. Sometimes, it is like a 5-year-old kid, blabbing as if it doesn't understand the basics, other times, it is like an 80-year-old, pouring some tidbits of wisdom (artificial) in some ways.</p>
<h2 id="use-ai-as-a-copilot-not-a-pilot">Use AI as a copilot not a pilot</h2>
<p>Use AI as you are the senior and instruct it to do things in your favor, not let it take control and you follow like an idiot.  Don’t follow it blindly; steer it. Do not forget to think, a bit, do not remove the human element from the generation, convert that generation to your manifestation.</p>
<p>That is the point I'm trying to make, you need to focus on your craft, your inner conflict, and your inner curiosity that drives you to read this exact post, AI can't do that for you, it never will. There will always be a need to learn, to decide, to act, to manifest, to feel. This will lead to more data, and this will keep the AI up-to-date on what humans know collectively. Actually, AIs are no smarter than collective human intelligence, it is just not possible, because whatever it is trained on is human data that humans know, have observed, have felt, and have manifested, it can hallucinate that it might be like this, who is there to confirm it?</p>
<h2 id="humans">Humans</h2>
<p>Humans are not doomed, it is AI that will be if humans stop doing their actions. Stop worrying, start enjoying, start manifesting, start exploring, just start doing things. If we rely too much on AI generation, it would be a disaster that you don't want to be in, a fogged mind, rusted by its inability to think, to feel, to act. We’ve got to keep manifesting, writing songs, snapping photos, dreaming up what’s next. That’s how we stay ahead, how we keep humanity humming.</p>
<p>You got this!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
<p>This looks like a ramble, but please don't judge me, I am just a junior software developer trying to navigate life, and based on what I observe and know, it feels this way.</p>
