<p>“Sometimes, when things are falling apart, they may actually be falling into place”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just my life right now, I don’t know anything happening to me right now, I am just waking up and banging in the day with a pinch of salt to survive, that is not the right mentality I know, but there’s a fear of burnout and losing the job at hand in this tough times, so just keeping the grind on is the solution for me I guess.</p>
<p>I can just hope to fall in place, things are messy but from the overall picture of life, I hope they are heading towards where they should be.</p>

<p>Never found a situation to use this, but man, this would be soo handy to know.</p>

<p>Best Engineering interview question I’ve ever gotten:<br>
This was a reaction of the MemSQL multiply command or functionality addition in the C codebase with time constraints, It was really not challenging but would make a lot of things clear and open about the developer in an interview.</p>
