<p>Life will give you moments that you think will haunt you, that time, you’ll look back and say, if only I could change that. Nope, don’t look back, reflect yes. Don’t overthink and regret, just pause, understand what went wrong, deep breathe, it’s ok we are all learning, I had done this mistake, admit and move ahead.</p>
<p>Life is too short, to enjoy the past ride, enjoy the current landscape, AI, LLMs, AI Agents, Model Context Protocol, so many things to learn. Don’t corner yourself and feel restrictive about mistakes or disappointments, think about what excites you, get that habbit and embrace it.</p>

Getting a blog post featured at hackernews, hmm, I always wonder how a post gets featured at hackernews, does the author submit it to the site, or the community post it there? Really curious about the working of it.</li>
<li><a href="https://xuanwo.io/links/2025/02/personal-software-is-becoming-a-trend/">Personal Software is becoming a trend</a><br>
Wasn’t this the hobby of software developers from the beginning, we try to solve problems and eventually land up a project a software for our own nerdy needs.</li>

This model looks worse, no comments. Haven’t tried yet, but this commentary gave a good gist about what to expect.</li>

<li><a href="https://youtu.be/rAEqP9VEhe8?si=exMiTiElXTPv4TjV">Indirect Prompt injection in LLMs - Numberphile</a><br>
This is really interesting, I mean corrupting the data source is so easy, write a few blog posts, publish on the internet and source it in your RAG and let hallucination be in the peek. What a problem to have, more advancements, more harder problems to solve. Man! becoming a security person is valuable then ever.Double click to interact with video</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/1bxNuY_a1xo">Legion AI Agent Framework</a><br>
This frameworks looks so like other frameworks, not sure why make one so much fuss about. I mean I get it, for learning purposes it is so cool, even I would like to try making one, but committing to it as a publicly available project as a real project and not a silly side project, seems a engagement bait or something. Just do it man.Double click to interact with video</li>

<ul>
<li>Use positive conditions (or names or end variable names) instead of negative conditions
<ul>
<li>For example if you have to control the case of a string, i.e. upper of lower case, use the parameter case_sensitive=True instead of ignore_case=True. The word ignore impacts the thinking and messes up the logic inside of head and lead to mistakes while writing, however more on the reading code.</li>
<li>This lesson I have read a few places and now I see why it is important. I will write a short rambling advice post on my blog soon this weekend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continue as you like it is the word for LLMs to continue after you added a prompt that gets rejected by the LLM</li>
<li>Writing python is like tactile keyboard and writing golang is mechanical keyboard. Food for thought for next week, one more blog post to be written.</li>
<li>Pivot table in google sheets. A real handy way to sort out and do data analysis from other sheets, or I should say master data.</li>
