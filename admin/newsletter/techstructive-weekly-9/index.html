Need to get one video out this weekend to get into the habit. This October I will be trying to build my own writing routine, it won’t be for technical articles, but I won’t be surprised if I find it helpful to write more technical articles.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This week, I had times where I said, I can still solve problems, Look LLMs you are still idiot. The next day, it just helped me just a function with some function signature and proper data type of parameters and return value. I am not saying, LLMs are complete idiots, but they don’t have sense what they are talking about, they sound like they have, but no, sorry. I would love to improve my productivity, by that I mean to speed up my process for searching, copy pasting from elsewhere, scrambling all over the internet to understand something. It just is like a little pipeline, I throw at it some things, If it makes sense to me, I accept, else I trash it, back to old ways.\u0026lt;\/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thanks for reading Techstructive Weekly!

<p>This week was a bit of refreshing as I was able to write some code, bunch of experimentation and feeling a bit back after some slump in the past week. Need to get one video out this weekend to get into the habit. This October I will be trying to build my own writing routine, it won’t be for technical articles, but I won’t be surprised if I find it helpful to write more technical articles.</p>
<p>This week, I had times where I said, I can still solve problems, Look LLMs you are still idiot. The next day, it just helped me just a function with some function signature and proper data type of parameters and return value. I am not saying, LLMs are complete idiots, but they don’t have sense what they are talking about, they sound like they have, but no, sorry. I would love to improve my productivity, by that I mean to speed up my process for searching, copy pasting from elsewhere, scrambling all over the internet to understand something. It just is like a little pipeline, I throw at it some things, If it makes sense to me, I accept, else I trash it, back to old ways.</p>

<p>I will be making up for the <a href="https://techstructively.substack.com/p/techstructive-weekly-8">last week</a> slump, I said in the quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Courage doesn't always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow”</p>
<p>— Mary Anne Radmacher</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here I am proving it, I am excited to get into the weekend, pumped up and ready for a change in habits and routine. Last week I was frustrated, maybe burned out, I practically didn’t do anything last weekend, but I din’t quit, I said will be back next week.</p>
<p>Actually last week I had my convocation, I remembered it now. The Saturday, the whole day went in that, hanging out with friends, maybe for the last time officially. It feels a bit bitter-sweet that I completed 4 years of the degree college.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;&quot;Fall seven times, stand up eight.&quot;<br>
— Japanese Proverb</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The past few weeks were tough for me, not as any bad thing, but just things are bit off for me. This week, I still showed up and tackled every thing that came my way, successful or not, I am still standing and doing the thing I love, debugging code :)</p>
<p>Keep walking</p>
