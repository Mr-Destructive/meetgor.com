<li><a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2025-02-09-one-failed-year/?ref=dailydev">A slow blogging year</a>: Wow, I also need to do some posts this year, I moved from 41 (2021), 40 (2022), 11 (2023), and 14 (2024). Need to write more, On the initial day, I had too much to express, but as days progressed, the friction reduced but the quality of that increased, first, it was about quantity, the motivation, and then it was consistency about improving.</li>

<li>How (junior) developers are getting screwed:<br>
I agree with this point, AI is a double-edged sword. If used properly it is a weapon, but if used without knowing what it is doing, it would not help in the long run.

How to use AI effectively as a developer, previously which was searching, debugger, and documentation, next it will be one more tool in the toolbelt.Double click to interact with video</li>

<li><a href="https://community.openai.com/t/openai-roadmap-and-characters/1119160">OpenAI roadmap</a>: This is big, the GPT-5 will be the last model for GPT family, i.e. the next models will be thinking-based and not just predicting the next token-like models, I mean those will be token prediction only but the way the final token will come as final will be lot more nuanced and not silly. Instead of us prompting it again (this is wrong, what about this <!-- raw HTML omitted --> case??) it will think thoroughly and give the result.</li>
