If you are like me who writes Python very badly, it has empty lines with whitespaces, no proper format in assigning variables, not formatted according to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standards, and you use Vim as your text editor then my friend you need a autocmd badly for it.

## Install Black in Python

Install the [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) package in python globally or locally as per your preferences.

```
pip install black
```

OR with pipx

```
pipx install black
```

For a detailed guide about running packages with pipx head toward my article on [pipx](https://mr-destructive.github.io/techstructive-blog/pipx-intro/).

## Set up Autocmd in Vim

We can set up a autocmd. What is a autocmd? It is about running commands when certain events occur like running a command when a file is saved, a buffer is opened or closed, and so on. What we want is to run the black command from the shell when the current file is saved. 

So, we can create a autocmd as follows:

```vimscript
autocmd BufWritePost * !black %
```

Now, this will run when any type of file is saved, so we will make it specific to python by adding a `*.py` to add in the autocmd.

```vimscript
autocmd BufWritePost *.py !black %
```

This works, but it gives a prompt after the command has been executed, to run the command silently we can simply add the silent keyword before the execution of the command from the shell.

```vimscript
autocmd BufWritePost *.py silent !black %
```

This looks perfect! 

But still, we need to add a auto-group(`augroup`) that groups the autocmds and by adding `autocmd!` it will clear all the commands from the group. 

```vimscript
augroup python_format
    autocmd!
    autocmd BufWritePost *.py silent !black %
augroup end
```
We can now add it to the vimrc to work all the time.

## Using pipx 

If you have used pipx to install black, you need to setup the autocmd a bit differently. 

```vimscript
autocmd BufWritePost *.py silent !pipx run black %
```

It might be a bit slower than running with global installation, but it is a neat way to run python package. 

So, that's it we can now write clean and safe python code without breaking a sweat in Vim. Happy Coding :)
