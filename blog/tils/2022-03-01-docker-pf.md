## Docker Port Forwarding

Port forwarding is a process to redirect the communication of one address to other. 
It is also known as Port Binding. 
We can use `-p` command to use port forwarding in our local Docker environment.

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 django-app
```

The first port number is the local machine port and followed by a `:` is the container port number.
SO, the request from the container port are forwarded to the local/outside world in the docker environment.

Additionally, we need to expose the container port first. We can do that in the Dockerfile or by adding a `-e` argument followed by the port to expose. This will open the port on container to forward the requests to the specified port in the `-p` option.

In the Dockerfile, we can expose the port by adding the command `EXPOSE 8000`, or any other port number.
