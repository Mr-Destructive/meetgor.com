Probably not, will it impact you, probably yes in a good way, will drain some time but I can guarantee after 3 years of blogging, you will have a better understanding (at least something) from what you had before writing.

<li>If you want to send a pure json response from API, and if for some reason, you code deals with numpy or dataframe in that case, then you might get into problems if not handled correctly. If you don’t convert or cast the lower level values (int64, char, etc used by numpy low level C) into python data types then you might get errors while decoding back to json. So make sure you cast back to higher level types. Had to debug for 3 hours to figure out where the heck the issue is coming from.</li>
<li>What is the better approach to find a sub-string match with a list of keywords.
So, let’s say I have a string
<code>this is a large language model</code>
and a sub-string to be found
<code>language model</code>
If language model is present then it is good, but let’s say the string is truncated to
<code>this is a large language mod</code>
In this case <code>language mod </code>is partially in <code>language model</code> it should still be allowed, however it’s a bit tricky and have tons of edge cases covering various strings.</li>
