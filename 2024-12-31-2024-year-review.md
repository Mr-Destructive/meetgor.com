article_html: "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>It is the end of the year, and I write this
  yearly as I have been writing it since <a href=\"https://www.meetgor.com/tag/developer-life/\">2022</a>.
  I get a lot of insights on the things after writing them. Let’s dive in for my journey
  from intern to full-time backend developer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“2024, You had
  me in the first half”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No jokes here, I was scared as shit
  till May 31st, something special happened on May 31st, 2024 in my life!</p>\n<p>Well,
  I got a full-time offer letter and the results of my bachelor’s degree which I passed
  with an 8.9 CGPA (not good but not bad either). If someone had to tell me an hour
  could change your life then this would be the day, exactly between 5 and 6 in the
  evening, I went from dropped shoulders to the happiest person in the world.</p>\n<p>I
  can’t describe that feeling; it has a special place in my heart. From June 2023
  to May 2024, I faced rejections left and right, but there was hope, a flicker of
  fire left that carried me here. I went from having nothing to being overwhelmed
  by so many great things that happened to me.</p>\n<p>I am grateful to my parents,
  family, manager, friends, and Mother Nature for blessing me with whatever I receive
  in 2024 \U0001F979</p>\n<h3>Gist</h3>\n<p>It was a good year, I learned a lot. I
  can say confidently I am more mature than I was a year ago. The year 2023 was a
  bit harsh for me, especially in the end, but that continued the effects for some
  time in 2024 as well. However, as I said, that single hour changed my life in a
  good way.</p>\n<p>I became more of a problem thinker than a software developer,
  I was solving real-life problems at work. I faced challenges and failed at times,
  but I reflected, learned from them, and moved ahead. This is the aim of this post
  as well. I want to learn from this year. It feels overwhelming at first, but if
  I put it word by word, sentence by sentence, then it becomes crystal clear where
  I shined and where I fumbled, and the holes in the wall.</p>\n<p>I feel like the
  first half of 2024 was the test of my patience and consistency. I was interning
  at Docsumo, I was assigned the task of one specific feature, then I got a few more
  tasks simultaneously and kept on chipping in bug fixes and understanding of the
  codebase, which by the end of one quarter I was given the sole responsibility of
  maintenance. That was not as boring as you might expect, it was challenging, it
  was about thinking through edge cases and solving the issues that the users were
  facing. This helped me develop my problem-solving skills and improve my communication
  skills.</p>\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hard work pays off, it might take
  time, but it does, patience is the key</li>\n<li>Things can change in an instance,
  don't wait for the right/perfect time, make every second count</li>\n<li>People
  are going to judge anyway, so don't hold back on the things that you wish to do,
  and don't let that fear hold you</li>\n<li>Writing is one of the things that can
  make your thoughts and impact immortal (to some extent)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I won't
  leave this article without a quote or two, I really think quotes can change your
  perspective of life (not all obviously, but some)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Do
  one thing every day that scares you&quot;\n-- Eleanor Roosevelt</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I
  started recording videos, recording the voice-over (yikes, I hated my voice for
  the initial few videos, I still hate it, but have gotten used to it).\nI don't just
  say, I do! Or I do and then say like this article \U0001F60E</p>\n<p>One more, please?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;It's
  not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.&quot;\n-- Abraham
  Lincoln</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is how I feel right now, I overcame one obstacle
  in my life, and the other is right here waiting for me to shoot down. You can't
  wait for life to ease out for you, you will have to find happiness in the hardships
  and highs and lows in your life.</p>\n<h2>Achievements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Land
  a full-time offer as a junior backend developer at <a href=\"https://www.docsumo.com/\">Docsumo</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Started
  a YouTube channel, despite fear and doubts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Started a <a href=\"https://techstructively.substack.com/\">Tech
  Newsletter</a> (summary of my learnings) with 23 editions written in 23 weeks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Created
  a writing routine for 50 days (wrote some literature/philosophical-related articles)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I
  feel good, but there is a mountain to climb. It is a marathon, not a sprint. I am
  excited about the year ahead, all the things I will learn, what responsibilities
  will be given, and will I make new connections in tech.</p>\n<h2>Technical Retrospective</h2>\n<p>I
  would like to view the year into the things I created namely the blogs and the video
  that I made.</p>\n<h3>Articles Written</h3>\n<p>This could have been better but
  still managed to write around 13 articles (excluding this), about Cody setup in
  Neovim, Nginx basics, Golang HTTP POST and PUT methods, Advent of Code approach
  and solutions in Golang.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetgor.com/neovim-sourcegraph-cody/\">Configuring

  September 9th I published my first YouTube video, I always wanted to create some
  tutorial about the things I know or want to learn. On that day, I kept my doubts
  and fears aside and hit the record button. It went bad, but I published the video.
  It took me roughly 5 hours to record the voice-over for a 6-minute video, I was
  in shambles after that. I then decided to double down on creating YouTube videos,
  to remove my fear of communicating, speaking, and expressing ideas and emotions
  through YouTube. And after 4 months, I have published around 14 videos. Not only
  that, I started to do live streams on weekends as well. I did around 16 live streams
  on Twitch and YouTube, I feel a lot better and a lot more confident.</p>\n<p>And
  yes the time required for me to create a video, record voice-over, and do the editing
  is significantly improving with each video, the last video I posted of 50 minutes,
  I recorded within an hour, one shot, and the next hour, the video was published.
  If I am the only person to benefit from my videos, then so be it.</p>\n<p>Here is
  the summary of the videos I made from September to December:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Using
  Turso LibSQL Database in Golang [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/vBrvX0X0phw?si=eEDV_qa9uXqI_vyK\">remote-connection</a>]
  [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/BitxB40rdVw?si=E3KK1hoGf1hY0klq\">embedded replicas</a>]
  [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/rIXePHhdUSI?si=IYk9A4zpBvr9pILf\">libsql local server</a>]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Using
  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9kMeb7d2id8?si=FHyFKcXme8WyFij_\">Goose</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mv1vCqUy_5o?si=dG25tC1U_zsoAhPd\">SQLC</a>
  with LibSQL in a Golang Application</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BY2Z2Em7OdA?si=u2zjCWoOOI4wRivC\">Deploying
  Netlify cloud functions in Golang</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What’s new in Golang
  1.24 [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hee9KUhvQsY?si=FqhGRXbhKOgPrVLj\">SplitSeq</a>]
  [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/RFUz4_axOZg?si=88iUnjGBKCx_fFiv\">Omit Zero JSON Tag</a>]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advent
  of Code [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4U97gLyz0Ss?si=vxfmbQxaaUf1GRmk\">day-1</a>]
  [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/jGrPkldp4rY?si=Brdb1ulBYwUfXr7F\">day-2</a>] [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/nhueQbOKdTs?si=MjHPXbKoCml5x-Ut\">day-3</a>]
  [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/029R_DKLqko?si=Iv5rVD_meKlXbMJs\">day-4</a>] [<a href=\"https://youtu.be/7pl7WRmfepQ?si=QdGigfhn04rSUEp4\">day-5</a>]
  … ran out of time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I just have only 50 odd subscribers and
  a couple of thousand views, it is just the start, and I am not looking into the
  metrics right now, surely I am trying to improve and build a community, but numbers
  don't mean anything to me right now at least. I am creating videos that I would
  like to watch myself if I hadn't known about the concepts that I once didn't knew.</p>\n<h3>Open
  Source Contributions</h3>\n<p>I wanted to do many more open-source contributions,
  but since I worked on creating YouTube videos, I didn’t get much headspace to work
  on them. Next year I want to create some form a habit to read some code, that way
  I know I will bang my head to fix the issues or discover something new. Creating
  a chain of exploring, learning, and contributing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minor additions
  on <a href=\"https://github.com/turbot/steampipe/pull/4315\">steampipe</a> and <a
  href=\"https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso-cli/pull/815\">turso-cli</a> repositories\n<ul>\n<li>Added
  CSV flag for separator in db create command</li>\n<li>Fix the bug for only showing
  timing when verbose flag is set</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Projects Created</h3>\n<p>I
  created a few projects, some of them just to explore the technologies and little
  MVPs, one project that I can be open to showing is the <a href=\"https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/outsmarty\">Outsmarty</a>
  project. This project is like a Psyche Clone in Golang, it’s not a mobile application,
  it is a web app. I have not completed it as usual but it is a good concept that
  I created till most of the heavy lifting, I usually quit at the frontend interfaces.</p>\n<h2>Non-Technical
  Stuff</h2>\n<p>I was really into writing and reading in the second half of the year.
  I decided to create a morning routine for a couple of weeks, but Indian parents,
  had to put that routine into trash can, but it was a good experience while it lasted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Read
  6 books [<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82596574-meet\">GoodReads
  profile</a>]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wrote <a href=\"https://mythstomeaning.substack.com/\">50
  Posts</a> about mythology and philosophy</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully, as I carry
  forward this momentum and energy, I will likely have one novella completed this
  year. I not just hoping to do that I am planning it now.</p>\n<h2>Goals for 2025</h2>\n<p>Moving
  into 2025, I want to write more code and of course articles and videos. Let’s get
  more specific of what I am thinking of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Write blogs for FreeCodeCamp
  (at least 3)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn Kubernetes in detail</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write
  25 articles on 100-days-of-Golang</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn Rust or Zig</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Get
  2K subscribers on YouTube (100 videos)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It
  was a year to remember for sure. I said this last year as well but in a bad way.
  If there was a year to forget, it would have been late 2023 and the first half of
  2024, but the second half of 2024 was a blessing for me. I overcame my fear of speaking
  to some extent, at least starting to address the issues.</p>\n<p>If I were to sum
  up the year, I am definitely happier than I was last year, and a lot more excited
  than I was last year. Money can't buy happiness, if you don't find joy within, nothing
  can be happiness. I think curiosity, consistency, and grit are pillars of my life
  and I stick to it this year and want to continue to do so.</p>\n<p>I will leave
  you with one more quote,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Life is not about waiting for
  the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain.&quot;\n-- Vivian Greene</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I
  hope your year was good too, if not may 2025 be the year of your dreams, you absolutely
  got this.</p>\n<p>See you on the other side \U0001F44B</p>\n<p>Happy New Year \U0001F386</p>\n<p>And
  as always,</p>\n<p>Happy Coding :)</p>\n"

description: A developer retrospective of the year 2024. A reflection of the goals
  that I worked towards in tech as a developer. Created tech YouTube channel and a
  weekly newsletter in later second half of the year, got a full time software developer
  job, and learned a ton of things.

## Introduction

It is the end of the year, and I write this yearly as I have been writing it since [2022](https://www.meetgor.com/tag/developer-life/). I get a lot of insights on the things after writing them. Let’s dive in for my journey from intern to full-time backend developer.

> “2024, You had me in the first half”

No jokes here, I was scared as shit till May 31st, something special happened on May 31st, 2024 in my life!

Well, I got a full-time offer letter and the results of my bachelor’s degree which I passed with an 8.9 CGPA (not good but not bad either). If someone had to tell me an hour could change your life then this would be the day, exactly between 5 and 6 in the evening, I went from dropped shoulders to the happiest person in the world.

I can’t describe that feeling; it has a special place in my heart. From June 2023 to May 2024, I faced rejections left and right, but there was hope, a flicker of fire left that carried me here. I went from having nothing to being overwhelmed by so many great things that happened to me.

I am grateful to my parents, family, manager, friends, and Mother Nature for blessing me with whatever I receive in 2024 🥹

### Gist

It was a good year, I learned a lot. I can say confidently I am more mature than I was a year ago. The year 2023 was a bit harsh for me, especially in the end, but that continued the effects for some time in 2024 as well. However, as I said, that single hour changed my life in a good way.

I became more of a problem thinker than a software developer, I was solving real-life problems at work. I faced challenges and failed at times, but I reflected, learned from them, and moved ahead. This is the aim of this post as well. I want to learn from this year. It feels overwhelming at first, but if I put it word by word, sentence by sentence, then it becomes crystal clear where I shined and where I fumbled, and the holes in the wall.

I feel like the first half of 2024 was the test of my patience and consistency. I was interning at Docsumo, I was assigned the task of one specific feature, then I got a few more tasks simultaneously and kept on chipping in bug fixes and understanding of the codebase, which by the end of one quarter I was given the sole responsibility of maintenance. That was not as boring as you might expect, it was challenging, it was about thinking through edge cases and solving the issues that the users were facing. This helped me develop my problem-solving skills and improve my communication skills.


## Lessons learned

- Hard work pays off, it might take time, but it does, patience is the key
- Things can change in an instance, don't wait for the right/perfect time, make every second count
- People are going to judge anyway, so don't hold back on the things that you wish to do, and don't let that fear hold you
- Writing is one of the things that can make your thoughts and impact immortal (to some extent)

I won't leave this article without a quote or two, I really think quotes can change your perspective of life (not all obviously, but some)

> "Do one thing every day that scares you"
> -- Eleanor Roosevelt

I started recording videos, recording the voice-over (yikes, I hated my voice for the initial few videos, I still hate it, but have gotten used to it).
I don't just say, I do! Or I do and then say like this article 😎

One more, please?

> "It's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years." 
> -- Abraham Lincoln

This is how I feel right now, I overcame one obstacle in my life, and the other is right here waiting for me to shoot down. You can't wait for life to ease out for you, you will have to find happiness in the hardships and highs and lows in your life.

## Achievements

* Land a full-time offer as a junior backend developer at [Docsumo](https://www.docsumo.com/)
    
* Started a YouTube channel, despite fear and doubts
    
* Started a [Tech Newsletter](https://techstructively.substack.com/) (summary of my learnings) with 23 editions written in 23 weeks
    
* Created a writing routine for 50 days (wrote some literature/philosophical-related articles)
    

I feel good, but there is a mountain to climb. It is a marathon, not a sprint. I am excited about the year ahead, all the things I will learn, what responsibilities will be given, and will I make new connections in tech.

## Technical Retrospective

I would like to view the year into the things I created namely the blogs and the video that I made.

### Articles Written

This could have been better but still managed to write around 13 articles (excluding this), about Cody setup in Neovim, Nginx basics, Golang HTTP POST and PUT methods, Advent of Code approach and solutions in Golang.

* [Configuring Sourcegraph’s Cody in Neovim](https://www.meetgor.com/neovim-sourcegraph-cody/)
    
* [NGINX Survival Guide](https://www.meetgor.com/series/nginx-survival-guide/)
    
* [100 Days of Golang](https://www.meetgor.com/series/100-days-of-golang/): Edition 34th and 35th Article about [POST](https://www.meetgor.com/golang-web-post-method/) and [PUT](https://www.meetgor.com/golang-web-put-method/) method
    
* Using LibSQL Database in Golang: [Connection](https://www.meetgor.com/turso-libsql-db-golang/) and using [Embedded Replicas](https://www.meetgor.com/turso-libsql-embedded-replicas-golang/)
    
* [Safely using Maps in Golang: The difference between declaration and initialization](https://www.meetgor.com/golang-safely-using-maps/)
    
* [Advent of Code, 2024 in Golang](https://www.meetgor.com/series/advent-of-code-2024/): Approach and Solution Explanation (till day 5, might write a few more, have some rough drafts to be completed)
    

### Youtube Channel

On September 9th I published my first YouTube video, I always wanted to create some tutorial about the things I know or want to learn. On that day, I kept my doubts and fears aside and hit the record button. It went bad, but I published the video. It took me roughly 5 hours to record the voice-over for a 6-minute video, I was in shambles after that. I then decided to double down on creating YouTube videos, to remove my fear of communicating, speaking, and expressing ideas and emotions through YouTube. And after 4 months, I have published around 14 videos. Not only that, I started to do live streams on weekends as well. I did around 16 live streams on Twitch and YouTube, I feel a lot better and a lot more confident.

And yes the time required for me to create a video, record voice-over, and do the editing is significantly improving with each video, the last video I posted of 50 minutes, I recorded within an hour, one shot, and the next hour, the video was published. If I am the only person to benefit from my videos, then so be it.


Here is the summary of the videos I made from September to December:

* Using Turso LibSQL Database in Golang \[[remote-connection](https://youtu.be/vBrvX0X0phw?si=eEDV_qa9uXqI_vyK)\] \[[embedded replicas](https://youtu.be/BitxB40rdVw?si=E3KK1hoGf1hY0klq)\] \[[libsql local server](https://youtu.be/rIXePHhdUSI?si=IYk9A4zpBvr9pILf)\]
    
* Using [Goose](https://youtu.be/9kMeb7d2id8?si=FHyFKcXme8WyFij_) and [SQLC](https://youtu.be/mv1vCqUy_5o?si=dG25tC1U_zsoAhPd) with LibSQL in a Golang Application
    
* [Deploying Netlify cloud functions in Golang](https://youtu.be/BY2Z2Em7OdA?si=u2zjCWoOOI4wRivC)
    
* What’s new in Golang 1.24 \[[SplitSeq](https://youtu.be/hee9KUhvQsY?si=FqhGRXbhKOgPrVLj)\] \[[Omit Zero JSON Tag](https://youtu.be/RFUz4_axOZg?si=88iUnjGBKCx_fFiv)\]
    
* Advent of Code \[[day-1](https://youtu.be/4U97gLyz0Ss?si=vxfmbQxaaUf1GRmk)\] \[[day-2](https://youtu.be/jGrPkldp4rY?si=Brdb1ulBYwUfXr7F)\] \[[day-3](https://youtu.be/nhueQbOKdTs?si=MjHPXbKoCml5x-Ut)\] \[[day-4](https://youtu.be/029R_DKLqko?si=Iv5rVD_meKlXbMJs)\] \[[day-5](https://youtu.be/7pl7WRmfepQ?si=QdGigfhn04rSUEp4)\] … ran out of time

I just have only 50 odd subscribers and a couple of thousand views, it is just the start, and I am not looking into the metrics right now, surely I am trying to improve and build a community, but numbers don't mean anything to me right now at least. I am creating videos that I would like to watch myself if I hadn't known about the concepts that I once didn't knew.
    

### Open Source Contributions

I wanted to do many more open-source contributions, but since I worked on creating YouTube videos, I didn’t get much headspace to work on them. Next year I want to create some form a habit to read some code, that way I know I will bang my head to fix the issues or discover something new. Creating a chain of exploring, learning, and contributing.

* Minor additions on [steampipe](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe/pull/4315) and [turso-cli](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso-cli/pull/815) repositories
    - Added CSV flag for separator in db create command
    - Fix the bug for only showing timing when verbose flag is set

### Projects Created

I created a few projects, some of them just to explore the technologies and little MVPs, one project that I can be open to showing is the [Outsmarty](https://github.com/Mr-Destructive/outsmarty) project. This project is like a Psyche Clone in Golang, it’s not a mobile application, it is a web app. I have not completed it as usual but it is a good concept that I created till most of the heavy lifting, I usually quit at the frontend interfaces.

## Non-Technical Stuff

I was really into writing and reading in the second half of the year. I decided to create a morning routine for a couple of weeks, but Indian parents, had to put that routine into trash can, but it was a good experience while it lasted.

* Read 6 books \[[GoodReads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82596574-meet)\]
    
* Wrote [50 Posts](https://mythstomeaning.substack.com/) about mythology and philosophy
    

Hopefully, as I carry forward this momentum and energy, I will likely have one novella completed this year. I not just hoping to do that I am planning it now.

## Goals for 2025

Moving into 2025, I want to write more code and of course articles and videos. Let’s get more specific of what I am thinking of:

* Write blogs for FreeCodeCamp (at least 3)
    
* Learn Kubernetes in detail
    
* Write 25 articles on 100-days-of-Golang
    
* Learn Rust or Zig
    
* Get 2K subscribers on YouTube (100 videos)
    
## Conclusion

It was a year to remember for sure. I said this last year as well but in a bad way. If there was a year to forget, it would have been late 2023 and the first half of 2024, but the second half of 2024 was a blessing for me. I overcame my fear of speaking to some extent, at least starting to address the issues. 

If I were to sum up the year, I am definitely happier than I was last year, and a lot more excited than I was last year. Money can't buy happiness, if you don't find joy within, nothing can be happiness. I think curiosity, consistency, and grit are pillars of my life and I stick to it this year and want to continue to do so.

I will leave you with one more quote,

I hope your year was good too, if not may 2025 be the year of your dreams, you absolutely got this.

See you on the other side 👋

Happy New Year 🎆

And as always,

Happy Coding :)
