## A Backend developer that lives in the terminal

Hi, I’m Meet, also known as Mr. Destructive – a backend developer who thrives in the terminal. Currently an I.T. student based in India, my programming journey began as a self-taught developer with C and JavaScript. Over time, I expanded my skills to Python, C/C++, and Golang, contributing to open-source libraries and projects along the way.

I have a passion for building side projects, many of which you can explore in my portfolio. I’m also an avid learner and share my insights on my Techstructive Blog, where I write about Django, Vim, Golang, and more. When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading sci-fi, writing stories, and gaming.

Currently, I work at Docsumo as a Junior Backend Engineer, focusing on fraud detection and analytics for bank statements, after an internship role in Python development. Prior to this, I worked as a Backend Developer Intern at The Solar Labs, developing REST APIs and backend systems.
