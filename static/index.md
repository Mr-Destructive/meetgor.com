## A Backend Developer that lives in the terminal

### About Me

- Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Meet also known as Mr. Destructive.
- I am an I.T. student and based in India.
- Started my programming journey as a self-taught developer learning about the fundamentals with C and Javascript.
- Moving ahead in my academic career, I was able to pick up **Python** and **C/C++** as my primary languages.
- On a self-taught route, I started learning about **Golang** and contributed to open source [libraries](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Ago+user%3Amr-destructive+&type=repositories&s=stars&o=desc) and [projects](https://github.com/search?q=language%3Ago+author%3Amr-destructive++is%3Apr+is%3Amerged&type=pullrequests).
- Over the year, I have created a pile of side projects, some of which I have showcased on the [Projects Portfolio](/projects) page.
- Oh, I am a human of course! Outside of programming, I love reading science fiction, writing stories, and sometimes drawing. There's no programmer that doesn't love gaming, isn't there?
- I use Vim BTW

### Blog

- This is my blog and have named it as [Techstructive Blog.](/blog/)
- I post here about the things I learn mostly related to [Django](/tag/django), [Vim](/tag/vim), and [Golang](/tag/go).
